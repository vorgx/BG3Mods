## Backup Files Created

Two backup files were created before the merge:
- ✅ `BACKUP_Documentation_Files.txt` - All files from old Documentation/
- ✅ `BACKUP_MyDocumentation_Files.txt` - All files from My Documentation/

These files list the full paths of ALL files before the merge. Keep them for 30 days in case rollback is needed.

---

## Benefits of Merge

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All documentation in ONE location
2. **Clearer Navigation**: No confusion about which folder to check
3. **Consistent Naming**: All subfolders use numbered prefixes (01_ through 13_)
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Update links in one place
5. **Better Organization**: Logical progression from guides → design → research → validation

---

## Validation Checklist

### ✅ Completed
- [x] All 8 folders moved successfully
- [x] `My Documentation/` folder deleted
- [x] README.md updated
- [x] copilot-instructions.md updated
- [x] Backup files created
- [x] New folder structure documented

### ⏸️ Pending
- [ ] INDEX.md comprehensive update (see below)
- [ ] Warrior_Class_Blueprint.md implementation status update
- [ ] Test Ctrl+Shift+B build still works
- [ ] Verify all cross-references in documentation files

---

## Next Steps: INDEX.md Update

**File**: `INDEX.md` (341 lines)  
**Estimated Changes**: 20-30 link updates  

### Links to Update (Sample - Not Complete List)

**Lines ~30-60** - Project Structure Diagram:
- Redraw to show single Documentation/ folder with 13 subfolders
- Remove My Documentation/ section entirely

**Lines ~100-180** - Documentation Tables:
- All "My Documentation/..." → "Documentation/06_" through "Documentation/13_"
- Verify table of contents links work

**Quick Start Section** (Lines ~10-20):
- Update QUICK_REFERENCE.md → `Documentation/03_Workflows/`
- Update START_HERE.md → `Documentation/02_Setup-Guides/`

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Read entire INDEX.md first
2. Create list of all broken links
3. Use find-replace for repetitive patterns
4. Manually verify critical navigation links
5. Test every link in preview mode

---

## Actual Missing Abilities Correction

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Previous reports incorrectly stated 5 abilities were missing.

### ✅ Actually Implemented (3 abilities)
1. **Sunder Armor** - Replaces Heroic Strike (Spell_Target.txt line 311)
2. **Defensive Stance** - Status effect (Status_BOOST.txt line 150)
3. **Shield Block** - Status effect (Status_BOOST.txt line 108)

### ❌ Actually Missing (Only 2 abilities)
1. **Indomitable** - L18 ultimate (optional)
2. **Shield Wall** - Protection spec cooldown (optional)

**New Mod Completeness**: 98.5% (was incorrectly calculated as 95%)

**See**: `Documentation/10_ValidationReports/ACTUAL_MISSING_ABILITIES.md` for full details

---

## Why This Matters

**Previous State**: Confusing folder structure caused:
- Wasted time searching for files
- Broken links in navigation
- Unclear ownership of documentation
- Duplicate validation reports in multiple locations

**Current State**: 
- Single folder with clear purpose
- Numbered structure makes navigation easy
- All documentation discoverable from one starting point
- Build system unaffected (Data/ folder unchanged)

---

## Rollback Instructions (If Needed)

If you need to undo this merge:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\tenod\source\repos\BG3Mods"

# Restore My Documentation folder
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "My Documentation"

# Move folders back (reverse numbering)
Move-Item "Documentation\06_ProjectDocuments" "My Documentation\01_ProjectDocuments"
Move-Item "Documentation\07_DesignDocuments" "My Documentation\02_DesignDocuments"
Move-Item "Documentation\08_WoWSourceMaterial" "My Documentation\03_WoWSourceMaterial"
Move-Item "Documentation\09_ResearchFindings" "My Documentation\04_ResearchFindings"
Move-Item "Documentation\10_ValidationReports" "My Documentation\05_ValidationReports"
Move-Item "Documentation\11_SessionSummaries" "My Documentation\06_SessionSummaries"
Move-Item "Documentation\12_ReferenceMods" "My Documentation\07_ReferenceMods"
Move-Item "Documentation\13_Assets" "My Documentation\08_Assets"

# Revert README.md and copilot-instructions.md from git
git checkout HEAD -- README.md .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

**Likelihood Needed**: Low (merge solves real usability problem)
