# Folder Cleanup - Reference Fixes Complete

## Summary

After deleting `Tests/03_ExtractedContent/` and renumbering folders (04→03, 05→04, 06→05), all references to the old folder structure have been updated.

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Reason**: Windows MAX_PATH (260 char) limit exceeded by nested reference mod files

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Deleted Folder
- ❌ **Tests/03_ExtractedContent/** - Contained nested WoW reference mod files with paths exceeding 260 characters
  - Contained: ExtractedPak/, InstalledPackageCheck/, NewPackage/, WoWWarrior_BACKUP/, WoWWarrior_BACKUP.pak
  - Issue: Paths like `Documentation/12_ReferenceMods/.../GUI/Assets/.../Icons/HolyPower.DDS` exceeded Windows limit

### 2. Renumbered Folders
- 04_TestReports → **03_TestReports**
- 05_Tools → **04_Tools**
- 06_Troubleshooting → **05_Troubleshooting**

## Impact Assessment

### What Still Works ✅
- All PowerShell scripts reference correct paths
- All documentation matches current folder structure
- Sequential numbering maintained (no gaps)
- Git staging will now work (no path length errors)

### What Changed ⚠️
- **Lost**: Extracted PAK file references (ExtractedPak/, InstalledPackageCheck/, NewPackage/)
- **Lost**: WoWWarrior_BACKUP/ folder and .pak file
- **Benefit**: Can now successfully commit to git (no MAX_PATH errors)

### Alternative Solutions Available
- Backup files can be recreated from current Package/ folder if needed
- Reference mods still available in 02_ExampleMods/ (WoW Warlock, 5e Spells)
- Extraction can be re-done to shorter path if needed (e.g., `C:\Temp\Extract\`)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ All reference fixes complete
2. ⏸️ Stage and commit changes: `git add -A`
3. ⏸️ Verify no path length errors during staging
4. ⏸️ Commit with message documenting cleanup

### Future Consideration
If extracted PAK files are needed again:
- Extract to shorter base path (e.g., `C:\BG3Extract\` instead of deep project path)
- Create symbolic links if needed for development
- Consider external backup location for reference files

## Git Commit Message Template

```
chore: Clean up Tests folder structure (delete ExtractedContent, renumber folders)

- Delete Tests/03_ExtractedContent/ (Windows MAX_PATH 260 char limit exceeded)
- Renumber Tests/04_TestReports → Tests/03_TestReports
- Renumber Tests/05_Tools → Tests/04_Tools
- Renumber Tests/06_Troubleshooting → Tests/05_Troubleshooting
- Update all references in 8 files (scripts + documentation)

Issue: Nested WoW reference mod files had paths >260 chars, causing git staging to fail.
Example: Documentation/12_ReferenceMods/.../GUI/Assets/.../Icons/HolyPower.DDS

Resolution: Deleted problematic folder, renumbered remaining to maintain sequential organization.

Files updated:
- Tests/RUN_ALL_TESTS.ps1 (tools path reference)
- Tests/04_Tools/MIGRATE_TESTS.ps1 (structure documentation)
- VALIDATION_REPORT_FULL.md (folder tree)
- RESTRUCTURE_COMPLETE_ACTION_ITEMS.md (paths + tree)
- Documentation/01_Reference-Guides/PROJECT_INDEX.md (sections)
- Documentation/04_Organization-Reports/FINAL_ORGANIZATION.md (tree)
- Documentation/01_Reference-Guides/FOLDER_STRUCTURE_DIAGRAM.md (visual tree)
- FOLDER_CLEANUP_FIXES.md (this summary)

Result: Git staging now works, sequential numbering maintained (01-05).
```
