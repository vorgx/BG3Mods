## Documentation Quality Standards Applied

### 2. Proper Categorization
- **Keystone (L13)**: Auto-granted specialization-defining ability
- **Choice Nodes**: Organized by tier with "Pick 1 of X" notation
- **Passives (Auto-Granted)**: Clear level markers (L14, L16, L18, L20)

### 3. Consistent BG3 Implementation Details
- Damage formulas with dice notation (3d12+STR, 1d8, etc.)
- Status effects with durations (turns, not seconds)
- Cooldowns (Short Rest, Long Rest, OncePerTurn)
- Tags for categorization

### 4. Specialization Availability Clarity
- Clear "NOT Available" notices where needed (Arms - Mountain Thane)
- Availability matrix showing all 3 base specs
- Cross-references to other documents
