# Charge Modification Opportunities: Talents That Could Affect Charges

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Purpose**: Identify existing talents that could modify charge amounts, generation rates, or caps  
**Context**: Evaluating whether charge system would benefit from talent interactions

---

## 🔍 FINDINGS: Charge-Modifying Potential

### Current Implementation
**Result**: ❌ **NO abilities currently modify charge counts or cooldown charges**

**Why?** Current system uses simple cooldowns (OncePerShortRest, OncePerLongRest), so there's nothing to modify.

## 📊 NEW TALENTS WE COULD ADD

If we implement charges, we could add NEW talents that modify charge systems:

### Suggested New Talents (L13-L20 tier)

| Talent Name | Effect | Modifies | Specialization |
|-------------|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Relentless Assault** | +1 max MobilityCharge (3 total) | MobilityCharge | All |
| **Battle Hardened** | DefensiveCharge replenishes on ShortRest (not Rest) | DefensiveCharge | All |
| **Second Wind** | Killing blow refunds 1 DefensiveCharge | DefensiveCharge | All |
| **Tactical Mastery** | Start combat with +1 MobilityCharge (3/3) | MobilityCharge | All |
| **Storm Caller** | ThunderCharge cap +2 (max 5) | ThunderCharge | Mountain Thane |
| **Lightning Reflexes** | ThunderCharge generation +10% (45% from Shield Slam) | ThunderCharge | Mountain Thane |
| **Unstoppable Force** | +1 max TankCooldown (2 total) at 50% HP | TankCooldown | Protection |
| **Critical Momentum** | Crits grant +1 OverpowerCharge | OverpowerCharge | Arms |
| **Executioner's Focus** | Execute casts reduce all charge cooldowns by 1 turn | All Charges | Arms/Fury |

---

## 🎯 COMPARISON: Cooldown System vs Charge System (Talent Interactions)

### Cooldown System (Current)
**Talent Options**:
- ✅ Reduce cooldown by X turns
- ✅ Add 1 charge (but only if spell natively supports it)
- ❌ Cannot increase max charges
- ❌ Cannot refund charges dynamically
- ❌ Cannot have talents scale with charge count

**Example**: `ReduceCooldown(WAR_Shockwave,1)` - Reduces by 1 turn, that's it.

### Charge System (Proposed)
**Talent Options**:
- ✅ Restore charges on condition (kills, crits, procs)
- ✅ Increase max charge cap (`ActionResourceOverride`)
- ✅ Change replenish type (Rest → ShortRest → Combat)
- ✅ Scale effects based on charge count
- ✅ Refund charges on successful casts
- ✅ Grant bonus charges at combat start

**Example**: 
```
// Colossus L20 talent
"IF(StatusCount(WAR_COLOSSAL_MIGHT) >= 5):ActionResourceOverride(TankCooldown,2,0)"
// At max stacks, you get 2 tank cooldowns instead of 1
```

## ✅ EXISTING TALENTS THAT BENEFIT FROM CHARGES

These talents already have mechanics that would be ENHANCED by charge system:

| Talent | Current Mechanic | Charge System Enhancement |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Earthquaker** | Reduces Shockwave cooldown | Could grant +1 MobilityCharge on 3+ targets |
| **Thunder Blast** | Grants status for buffed Thunder Clap | Already perfect for ThunderCharge generation |
| **Opportunist** | Reduces Execute cooldown on crit | Could refund DefensiveCharge on marked crits |
| **Tide of Battle** | Reduces Revenge cooldown | Could increase TankCooldown max at 5 stacks |
| **Gathering Storms** | Restores Rage on lightning damage | Could increase ThunderCharge cap (L20 power spike) |
| **Overpower Proc** | Grants spell unlock on dodge | Perfect for OverpowerCharge system |
| **Overwhelming Blades** | Grants buff on Execute kill | Could refund MobilityCharge for chase mechanics |

**Total Talents That Could Interact**: **7+ existing talents** + **9 potential new talents** = **16 talent interactions**

---

## 🎮 EXAMPLE: L20 Colossus Build with Charge Modifiers

**Build**: Colossus Tank with charge-based talents

**Resources**:
- Rage: 100 (standard)
- TankCooldown: 2 (from Tide of Battle talent at 5 stacks)
- MobilityCharge: 3 (from Earthquaker refunds on AoE hits)
- DefensiveCharge: 1 (with refund on Demolish kills)

**Combat Flow**:
1. Build Colossal Might to 5 stacks → TankCooldown max → 2
2. Hit 3+ enemies with Shockwave → +1 MobilityCharge (3/2 = capped but refunded)
3. Use Demolish finisher (kill) → Refund DefensiveCharge (1/1)
4. Now have 2 tank cooldowns + extra mobility + defensive refund
5. Capstone talent at L20 allows strategic use of 2 major cooldowns

**Fantasy**: Master tactician who maximizes resource efficiency through skilled play

## 📋 SUMMARY

### ❌ Current System (No Charge Modifiers)
- **0 talents** modify cooldown charges (because no charges exist)
- **7 talents** reduce cooldowns by fixed amounts
- **Limited interaction** between talents and cooldowns

### ✅ Charge System (High Modifier Potential)
- **7 existing talents** could be enhanced to modify charges
- **9 new talents** could be added for charge interactions
- **16+ total interactions** between talents and charges
- **Much deeper customization**: Players can build around charge generation, max caps, refunds

### 🎯 RECOMMENDATION

**Charge system has SIGNIFICANTLY more talent interaction potential** because:
1. ✅ Charges can be **refunded** (kills, crits, conditions)
2. ✅ Charges can have **caps increased** (L20 power spikes)
3. ✅ Charges can **scale effects** (more charges = more damage)
4. ✅ Charges create **build-around gameplay** (proc-focused vs. charge-hoarding)

**Cooldown system is rigid**:
1. ❌ Can only reduce cooldown by X turns
2. ❌ Cannot refund cooldowns dynamically
3. ❌ Cannot increase "max cooldowns"
4. ❌ No scaling based on cooldown state

---

## ❓ DECISION IMPACT

If you choose **Option B (Rage + 5 Charges)**, we can:
- ✅ Enhance 7 existing talents with charge interactions
- ✅ Add 9 new talents in future updates for deeper customization
- ✅ Create build diversity (charge-focused vs. standard builds)
- ✅ Add power spikes at L13, L17, L20 via charge cap increases

If you choose **Option A (Rage Only)**, we:
- ❌ Keep 7 cooldown-reduction talents as-is (no enhancements)
- ❌ Cannot add charge-based talent interactions later (requires FILE 3 rework)
- ❌ Miss opportunity for deep customization

**Recommendation**: **Choose B** - The charge system unlocks 16+ talent interactions vs. 7 simple cooldown reductions.
