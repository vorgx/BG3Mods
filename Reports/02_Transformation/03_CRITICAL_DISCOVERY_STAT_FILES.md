## 🎯 KEY FINDINGS

### **Scale Difference**
- **Warlock:** 790 stat entries
- **Warrior:** 135 stat entries
- **Ratio:** Warlock has 5.85x MORE entries than Warrior

### **Missing Files (Warrior doesn't have):**
- ❌ `Character.txt` (63 entries) - Defines summonable demons/characters
- ❌ `Interrupt.txt` (5 entries) - Spell interrupts
- ❌ `Status_EFFECT.txt` (4 entries) - Special status effects
- ❌ `Object.txt` (2 entries) - Summonable objects

**Impact:** These files are for summoning mechanics (demons). Warrior doesn't need them.

### **Files We Have But Warlock Doesn't:**
- ✅ `Spell_Jump.txt` (2 entries) - Charge/Leap abilities (Warrior-specific)

## 🔍 Detailed File-by-File Analysis

### **1. Passive.txt**
- **Warlock:** 240 entries (30% of all entries)
- **Warrior:** 36 entries (27% of our entries)
- **Gap:** Warlock has 6.67x MORE passives
- **Analysis:**
  - Warlock has 9 talent rows × 3 choices × 3 subclasses = ~81 talent passives
  - Plus 3 hero talent trees × 7 levels × ~4 choices = ~84 hero talent passives
  - Plus passive effects for many abilities
  - **Our 36 passives:** Likely enough for our design (2 hero talent trees, simpler talent structure)
  - **Verdict:** ⚠️ Potentially adequate depending on design scope

### **2. Status_BOOST.txt**
- **Warlock:** 233 entries (29% of all entries)
- **Warrior:** 56 entries (42% of our entries)
- **Gap:** Warlock has 4.16x MORE status effects
- **Analysis:**
  - Status effects are buffs/debuffs applied by abilities
  - Warlock has 150+ abilities, each potentially applying 1-3 status effects
  - **Our 56 status effects:** May be adequate if abilities are simpler
  - **Verdict:** ⚠️ Depends on ability complexity

### **3. Spell_Target.txt**
- **Warlock:** 141 entries (18% of all entries)
- **Warrior:** 30 entries (22% of our entries)
- **Gap:** Warlock has 4.7x MORE single-target spells
- **Analysis:**
  - This is the primary ability file (targeted attacks/spells)
  - Warlock: Shadowbolt, Chaos Bolt, Demonbolt, Malefic Rapture, etc. (100+ spells)
  - **Our 30 entries:** Likely core Warrior abilities (Mortal Strike, Execute, Slam, etc.)
  - **Verdict:** ⚠️ Depends on how many abilities we're implementing

### **4. Spell_Projectile.txt**
- **Warlock:** 54 entries (7% of all entries)
- **Warrior:** 2 entries (1.5% of our entries)
- **Gap:** Warlock has 27x MORE projectiles
- **Analysis:**
  - Projectile spells = ranged attacks with travel time (Eldritch Blast, Shadowbolt projectiles)
  - Warriors are melee-focused, so 2 entries is reasonable (maybe Shield Toss, Heroic Throw?)
  - **Verdict:** ✅ Likely adequate for Warrior design

### **5. Spell_Shout.txt**
- **Warlock:** 47 entries (6% of all entries)
- **Warrior:** 3 entries (2% of our entries)
- **Gap:** Warlock has 15.67x MORE shouts/buffs
- **Analysis:**
  - Shouts = self-buffs, AoE buffs (Demon Armor, Fel Armor, etc.)
  - Warriors have shouts (Battle Shout, Rallying Cry, etc.)
  - **Our 3 entries:** Seems low for Warrior class (iconic shout class)
  - **Verdict:** ⚠️ Potentially missing Battle Shout, Commanding Shout, Demoralizing Shout, etc.

### **6. Spell_Zone.txt**
- **Warlock:** 1 entry (<1% of all entries)
- **Warrior:** 6 entries (4% of our entries)
- **Gap:** We have 6x MORE zone spells than Warlock!
- **Analysis:**
  - Zone spells = ground-targeted AoEs (Rain of Fire, Bladestorm, Whirlwind)
  - Warriors have more AoE abilities than Warlocks
  - **Verdict:** ✅ Makes sense for Warrior design

### **7. Character.txt (Warlock only)**
- **Warlock:** 63 entries (8% of all entries)
- **Warrior:** 0 entries (N/A)
- **Analysis:**
  - Defines summonable creatures (Imp, Voidwalker, Felhunter, etc.)
  - Each demon has stats, abilities, AI behavior
  - **Not needed for Warriors** (we don't summon pets)
  - **Verdict:** ✅ N/A for our design

## 🚨 HYPOTHESIS: Why Our Mod Crashes

### **Current Theory #1: Insufficient Lists Content**
- **Evidence:**
  - Warlock has 105 list entries (53 SpellLists + 52 PassiveLists)
  - We have 4 list entries (1 per file, mostly minimal)
  - Our PassiveLists.lsx has EMPTY Passives="" attribute
  - Our SpellLists.lsx only has 2 spells: "WAR_Charge;WAR_HeroicStrike"

- **Crash Mechanism:**
  - Progressions.lsx likely references list UUIDs via Selectors
  - Selectors try to pull from lists: `SelectPassives(UUID,1)`
  - If list UUID doesn't exist or list is empty → CRASH

- **Test This Theory:**
  1. Search Progressions.lsx for list UUID references
  2. Verify all referenced UUIDs exist in Lists files
  3. Verify all lists have actual content (not empty strings)

### **Current Theory #2: Missing Ability Implementations**
- **Evidence:**
  - We have 135 stat entries
  - Warlock has 790 stat entries (5.85x more)
  - Scale difference is MASSIVE

- **Crash Mechanism:**
  - Progressions.lsx grants spells: `AddSpells="WAR_SomeAbility"`
  - If `WAR_SomeAbility` doesn't exist in Spell_*.txt files → CRASH
  - Or if ability exists but references missing status effects → CRASH

- **Test This Theory:**
  1. Extract all spell names from Progressions.lsx
  2. Verify each spell exists in Spell_*.txt files
  3. Extract all status names from Spell_*.txt files
  4. Verify each status exists in Status_BOOST.txt

### **Current Theory #3: Structure is Correct, Content is Incomplete**
- **Evidence:**
  - Phase 31 restructure fixed all structural issues
  - All files have correct node IDs, attributes, formats
  - Validation showed 12/12 files structurally correct
  - Yet still crashes

- **Conclusion:**
  - **Structure ✅ = Files are formatted correctly**
  - **Content ❌ = Files don't have enough/correct entries**

## 📋 ACTION ITEMS FOR NEXT STEPS

### **Priority 1: Validate UUID References (Step 3)**
Extract all UUIDs from:
- Progressions.lsx (references to lists, spells, passives)
- Lists/*.lsx (list UUIDs)
- ClassDescriptions.lsx (class/subclass UUIDs, ProgressionTableUUID)
- ActionResourceDefinitions.lsx (Rage UUID)

Create cross-reference map:
```
Progression Level 2 references:
  - SelectPassives(UUID_X, 1) → Does UUID_X exist in PassiveLists.lsx?
  - AddSpells="WAR_Charge" → Does WAR_Charge exist in Spell_*.txt?
```

### **Priority 2: Verify Ability Implementations**
For every ability referenced in Progressions.lsx:
1. Confirm it exists in appropriate Spell_*.txt file
2. Check if it references status effects
3. Confirm those status effects exist in Status_BOOST.txt
4. Check for localization handles

### **Priority 3: Populate Lists Files**
Our PassiveLists.lsx has EMPTY Passives="" - this might be the crash!
- Need to populate with actual passive names
- Need to create multiple PassiveList entries (one per talent row)
- Need to create multiple SpellList entries (one per ability pool)

### **Priority 4: Count Actual Implemented Abilities**
Verify our 135 stat entries include:
- All base Warrior abilities (level 1-12)
- All Arms subclass abilities
- All Fury subclass abilities
- All Protection subclass abilities
- All hero talent abilities (levels 13-20)

## 🎯 REVISED CRASH HYPOTHESIS (HIGH CONFIDENCE)

**The crash is likely caused by ONE of these:**

1. **Empty Lists:** PassiveLists.lsx has `Passives=""` (empty string)
   - Progressions try to SelectPassives from empty list → CRASH
   - **FIX:** Populate with actual passive names

2. **Missing List UUIDs:** Progressions reference list UUIDs that don't exist
   - `SelectPassives(b2c3d4e5-..., 1)` but that UUID isn't in PassiveLists.lsx
   - **FIX:** Create list entries with matching UUIDs

3. **Missing Abilities:** Progressions grant spells that don't exist
   - `AddSpells="WAR_BattleShout"` but WAR_BattleShout not in Spell_Shout.txt
   - **FIX:** Implement missing abilities

4. **Missing Status Effects:** Abilities reference statuses that don't exist
   - Spell has `ApplyStatus(SELF,WAR_ENRAGE,100,6)` but WAR_ENRAGE not in Status_BOOST.txt
   - **FIX:** Implement missing status effects

## 📊 Summary Statistics

| Metric | Warlock | Warrior | Ratio |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| **Total Stat Entries** | 790 | 135 | 5.85:1 |
| **List Entries** | 105 | 4 | 26.25:1 |
| **Files** | 186 | ~13 | 14.3:1 |
| **Progressions** | 50+ | 54 | ~1:1 |
| **Classes** | 4 | 4 | 1:1 |

**Key Insight:** Structure matches (progressions, classes), but content volume is vastly different (lists, stat entries).

**Status:** STEP 2 ANALYSIS DEEPENED ✅  
**Critical Path Forward:** Validate UUID cross-references (Step 3), then populate Lists with actual content
