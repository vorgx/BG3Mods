## üèÜ MY RECOMMENDATION: **OPTION B**

**Why?**
1. **Proven Pattern**: Warlock mod (13K+ downloads) uses this successfully
2. **Future-Proof**: Can add 9 new charge-modifying talents later
3. **Specialization Identity**: Mountain Thane FEELS different (ThunderCharges)
4. **Flexibility**: Use 2 Heroic Leaps if you need mobility
5. **Visual Feedback**: Players SEE "2 Overpower procs ready!" 
6. **High Skill Ceiling**: Rewards good play (charge management, proc tracking)
7. **Build Diversity**: Charge-focused builds vs. standard builds
8. **Power Spikes**: L20 talents can increase charge caps (2 tank cooldowns!)

**Tradeoff**: Takes 4-6 hours instead of 15 minutes, but unlocks WAY more gameplay depth.
