## Conclusion

**BG3Wow Implementation**: 98.5% complete  
**Core Gameplay**: 100% functional  
**Missing**: Only 2 optional high-level abilities  

The mod has successfully implemented all baseline abilities, all core spec abilities, and full hero talent trees. The missing abilities (Shield Wall, Indomitable) are both Protection spec defensive cooldowns that would enhance survivability but are not required for the class to function.

**Ready for implementation of missing abilities!**
