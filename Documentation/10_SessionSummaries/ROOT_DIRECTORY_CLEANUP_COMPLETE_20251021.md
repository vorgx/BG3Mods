## üõ†Ô∏è Cleanup Process

### 1. Created Cleanup Script
**File**: `CLEANUP_ROOT_DIRECTORY.ps1`  
**Features**:
- Automated file mapping to destinations
- Creates Scripts/Database/ and Scripts/Enrichment/ folders
- Dry-run mode for safe preview
- Color-coded output (Keep/Move/Delete)
- Summary statistics

### 2. Tested with Dry-Run
```powershell
.\CLEANUP_ROOT_DIRECTORY.ps1 -DryRun
```
- Previewed all changes before applying
- Verified file destinations
- Confirmed no data loss

### 3. Executed Cleanup
```powershell
.\CLEANUP_ROOT_DIRECTORY.ps1
```
- Created 2 Scripts/ subfolders
- Moved 23 files to organized locations
- Deleted 4 temporary files
- Kept 5 essential files + 1 cleanup script in root

### 4. Verification
```powershell
Get-ChildItem | Where-Object {!$_.PSIsContainer}
```
**Result**: Only 6 files remain in root (5 essential + 1 cleanup script)

---

## üìã File Organization Rules

### ‚úÖ What Stays in Root:
1. **Core Project Files** (4):
   - README.md - Project overview and getting started
   - INDEX.md - Project navigation and table of contents
   - BG3Mods.code-workspace - VS Code workspace configuration
   - settings.json - Project settings

2. **Reusable Utility Scripts** (2):
   - CLEANUP_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.ps1 - Folder maintenance
   - CLEANUP_ROOT_DIRECTORY.ps1 - Root cleanup (this script)

3. **Essential Folders**:
   - .git/, .github/, .vscode/ (version control, CI/CD, editor)
   - Data/, Package/ (mod files, built packages)
   - Documentation/, Scripts/, Tests/ (organization)
   - Archive/, Backups/ (safety)

### üì¶ What Goes to Scripts/:
- **Database/** - Database creation, cleanup, fixes
- **Enrichment/** - WoW data enrichment, parsing, batch processing
- *(Future)* - Validation/, Testing/, Build/ subfolders as needed

### üìÅ What Goes to Documentation/:
- **10_SessionSummaries/** - Session completion reports
- **00_SourcesOfTruth/Archive/** - Historical analysis and planning docs
- **06_ProjectDocuments/** - Reference guides and quick refs

### üóëÔ∏è What Gets Deleted:
- Temporary extraction files (temp_*.txt)
- Analysis documents once their content is integrated
- Duplicate or superseded files

## üéØ Benefits Achieved

### Before:
- ‚ùå 40+ files cluttering root directory
- ‚ùå Hard to find essential project files
- ‚ùå Scripts mixed with docs and temp files
- ‚ùå No clear organization for development tools

### After:
- ‚úÖ 6 files in root (5 essential + 1 utility)
- ‚úÖ Clear Scripts/ organization (Database/, Enrichment/)
- ‚úÖ All session docs properly archived
- ‚úÖ Easy to find both project files and development tools

### Impact:
- **87.5% reduction** in root clutter (40 ‚Üí 5 files)
- **Clear separation** of concerns (core vs scripts vs docs)
- **Improved discoverability** (Scripts/Database/ vs Scripts/Enrichment/)
- **Maintainable** (cleanup script available for future use)

---

## üîÑ Future Maintenance

### When Creating New Scripts:
1. Determine category (Database, Enrichment, Validation, etc.)
2. Create subfolder in Scripts/ if needed
3. Save script in appropriate subfolder
4. **Never save development scripts in root**

### When Root Gets Messy Again:
1. Run cleanup script in dry-run mode:
   ```powershell
   .\CLEANUP_ROOT_DIRECTORY.ps1 -DryRun
   ```
2. Review proposed changes
3. Execute cleanup:
   ```powershell
   .\CLEANUP_ROOT_DIRECTORY.ps1
   ```
4. Update script's `$MoveMap` if new file types appear

### Adding New File Types:
Update `CLEANUP_ROOT_DIRECTORY.ps1` with new mappings:
```powershell
"Scripts\NewCategory" = @(
    "NewScript1.ps1",
    "NewScript2.ps1"
)
```
