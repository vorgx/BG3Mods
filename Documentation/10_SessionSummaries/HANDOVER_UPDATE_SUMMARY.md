## ðŸ“‹ Key Points for Next Session

### For AI Agent:
1. **Read handover**: `HANDOVER_NEXT_SESSION_OCT20.md`
2. **File cleanup plan**: `FILE_ORGANIZATION_PLAN_CORRECTED.md`
3. **Existing folders**: Use Documentation/ and Reports/ subfolders (13 + 4 exist)
4. **No new folders**: All files fit into existing structure

### For User:
**Opening message for new chat**:
```
Read HANDOVER_NEXT_SESSION_OCT20.md for our current status.

Before we start Section [5] Hero Talents, let's do the quick file cleanup first 
(5-10 minutes). Use the plan in FILE_ORGANIZATION_PLAN_CORRECTED.md.

This will:
1. Move 22 loose .md files to existing Documentation/ folders
2. Clean up root directory to only essential files
3. Update references in README, INDEX, SOURCE_OF_TRUTH
4. Give us a clean workspace for Section [5]

The plan uses existing folders - no new folders needed!
```
