## üí° KEY LEARNINGS

### What Worked Well
1. ‚úÖ **Hardcoded mechanics library** (SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md extraction) - Fast, reliable, high quality
2. ‚úÖ **Pattern-based enrichment** - Automated 32 passives in seconds
3. ‚úÖ **Incremental approach** - Build on existing documentation rather than parse complex HTML
4. ‚úÖ **Batch workflow** - ENRICH_MANUAL_WORKFLOW.ps1 makes manual research systematic

### What Didn't Work
1. ‚ùå **HTML parsing** - Too complex, fragile, time-intensive
2. ‚ùå **Regex on nested HTML** - Extracted wrong elements (navigation vs abilities)
3. ‚ùå **One-shot full enrichment** - Better to enrich in phases (50% ‚Üí 75% ‚Üí 90%)

### Efficiency Gains
- **Time saved vs original plan**: 18-23 hours (HTML parsing) ‚Üí 2 hours (docs + patterns)
- **Enrichment rate**: 35 abilities/hour (vs estimated 6-8 abilities/hour for manual)
- **Quality**: High - sourced from user's own documentation

### Scripts (Root Directory)
- `ENRICH_FROM_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.ps1` - Phase 1 enrichment
- `AUTO_ENRICH_PASSIVES.ps1` - Phase 2 enrichment
- `ENRICH_MANUAL_WORKFLOW.ps1` - Manual research workflow
- `PARSE_ICYVEINS_HTML.ps1` - (Abandoned) HTML parser
- `PARSE_ICYVEINS_SIMPLE.ps1` - (Abandoned) Simplified parser

## üöÄ RECOMMENDATION FOR NEXT SESSION

**Option A: Continue Enrichment (Recommended)**
- Reach 75-85% enrichment (160-180 abilities) in next 3-4 hours
- Focus on Offensive abilities (biggest gap)
- Use ENRICH_MANUAL_WORKFLOW.ps1 for systematic research

**Option B: Start Implementation with 54%**
- 116 enriched abilities is a solid foundation
- Covers core rotation + major cooldowns + most defensives
- Can fill gaps during implementation/testing

**My Recommendation**: **Option A** - Push to 75% enrichment (160+ abilities) before implementing. This ensures:
- All major cooldowns and rotation abilities are documented
- Spec-specific mechanics are clear
- Hero talent interactions are understood
- Implementation can proceed smoothly without constant research breaks
