## The 169 Non-Enriched Abilities (Need Work)

### Breakdown by Type

| Type | Count | Examples |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Passive** | 85 | Seasoned Soldier, War Machine, Leeching Strikes, Fast Footwork, Improved Execute, Critical Thinking, Deft Experience, Tactician |
| **Offensive** | 75 | Demoralizing Shout, Impending Victory, Martial Prowess, Intimidating Shout, Second Wind, Skullsplitter, Warbreaker, Massacre |
| **Defensive** | 7 | Fight Through the Flames, Brace For Impact, Armor Specialization, Honed Reflexes, Reinforced Plates |
| **Utility** | 2 | Bounding Stride, Storm of Steel |

### Why They're Not Enriched

These 169 abilities are in the **"90-ability review queue"** (actually 169 need work) because:

1. **Not in enrichment library** - The `COMPREHENSIVE_WOW_ENRICHMENT.ps1` script only had 46 abilities in its hash table
2. **Complex mechanics** - Many are passive modifiers that need custom BG3 functors
3. **Hero Talent abilities** - Mountain Thane, Colossus, Slayer tree passives need research
4. **Need Icy-Veins research** - Requires manual extraction of WoW mechanics

### Categories Needing Enrichment

**Hero Talent Passives** (~30 abilities):
- Mountain Thane tree (Avatar of the Storm, Thunder Blast, Thorim's Might, etc.)
- Colossus tree (Colossal Might, Demolish, Mountain of Muscle and Scars, etc.)
- Slayer tree (Slayer's Strike, Culling Cyclone, Reap the Storm, etc.)

**Passive Modifiers** (~40 abilities):
- Improved Execute, Critical Thinking (modify Execute)
- Deft Experience (modifies Tactician)
- Storm Wall (modifies Die by the Sword)
- Test of Might (modifies Colossus Smash)
- Merciless Bonegrinder (modifies Ravager)
- Dance of Death (modifies Bladestorm)
- Many more...

**Proc-Based Abilities** (~15 abilities):
- Tactician (resets Overpower)
- Fresh Meat (Bloodthirst procs)
- Sudden Death (Execute procs)
- Bloodsurge (procs)
- Storm Bolts (additional projectiles)

**Utility/Defensive Spells** (~10 abilities):
- Demoralizing Shout (AoE debuff)
- Intimidating Shout (AoE fear)
- Impending Victory (heal + damage)

## What Needs to Happen

### To Make ALL 215 Abilities Implementation-Ready

**Step 1: Research WoW Mechanics** (8-10 hours)
- Use Icy-Veins URLs from `WOW_SOURCE_REFERENCES.md`
- Extract mechanics for each of the 169 abilities
- Document rage costs, cooldowns, effects

**Step 2: Convert to BG3 Functors** (6-8 hours)
- Translate WoW mechanics to BG3 SpellSuccess syntax
- Design passive functor systems for modifiers
- Create target conditions for proc-based abilities
- Map to BG3 file types and spell types

**Step 3: Populate Database** (2-3 hours)
- Fill in all 28 columns for 169 abilities
- Add archetype tags
- Add Wowhead URLs
- Add implementation notes

**Step 4: Validate** (1 hour)
- Run validation script
- Check for missing data
- Verify syntax correctness

**Total Time**: ~20-25 hours of manual research + conversion work

## Strategic Options

### Option A: Enrich Everything First (20-25 hours)
**Pros**:
- Complete database before implementation
- No gaps during transformation
- Better planning visibility

**Cons**:
- Long delay before seeing working mod
- Some abilities may not be needed initially

### Option B: Implement 46 Now, Enrich As Needed (Recommended)
**Pros**:
- Working mod with core rotation ASAP
- 46 abilities covers all essential gameplay
- Learn what works before enriching rest

**Cons**:
- May need to pause transformation for research
- Some abilities blocked until enrichment

### Option C: Prioritized Enrichment (10-15 hours)
**Focus on**:
1. Core rotation abilities (already done ‚úÖ)
2. Class-defining passives (Improved Execute, Critical Thinking, Tactician)
3. Hero Talent keystones (3 keystones + major nodes)
4. Essential utilities (Demoralizing Shout, Intimidating Shout)

**Then** implement what's ready, enrich rest later.

---

## Recommendation

**Start implementation with the 46 fully enriched abilities NOW.**

These 46 cover:
- ‚úÖ Complete core rotation for all 3 specs
- ‚úÖ All major cooldowns
- ‚úÖ All mobility abilities
- ‚úÖ Essential utilities (interrupt, taunt, CC)
- ‚úÖ Primary defensives

You can **build a 100% playable Warrior mod** with just these 46 abilities. The remaining 169 are mostly:
- Passive stat boosts (nice-to-have, not essential)
- Hero Talent tree modifiers (L13-L20 content)
- Niche utilities

**Then enrich the remaining 169 in batches** as you add advanced features.

## Bottom Line

**Can you implement everything now?** ‚ùå **NO** - Only 46/215 (21.4%) are ready.

**Can you build a playable mod now?** ‚úÖ **YES** - Those 46 abilities are enough for full gameplay.

**Should you enrich everything first?** ü§î **OPTIONAL** - Depends on your priorities.
