## 🛠️ Cleanup Process

### 1. Created Cleanup Script
**File**: `CLEANUP_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.ps1`  
**Features**:
- Automated file mapping to archive folders
- Dry-run mode for safe preview
- Color-coded output (Keep/Archive/Move/Delete)
- Summary statistics

### 2. Tested with Dry-Run
```powershell
.\CLEANUP_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.ps1 -DryRun
```
- Previewed all changes before applying
- Verified file destinations
- Confirmed no data loss

### 3. Executed Cleanup
```powershell
.\CLEANUP_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.ps1
```
- Created 5 Archive/ subfolders
- Moved 36 files to appropriate archives
- Moved 2 files to project documentation
- Attempted to delete 1 temp file (Excel had it locked)

### 4. Updated Documentation
**File**: `Documentation/00_SourcesOfTruth/README.md`  
**Updates**:
- Added current folder structure (4 files + Archive/)
- Added folder maintenance guidelines
- Added "4 files only" policy
- Added cleanup script reference
- Updated timestamps and changelog

## 📋 Folder Maintenance Policy

### What Belongs in Root (ONLY 4 files):
1. **SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md** - Master living document
2. **AbilityDatabase_Warrior_FullyEnriched.csv** - Production database
3. **Warrior Progression for all subclasses.xlsx** - Excel source
4. **README.md** - Folder documentation

### What Goes to Archive/:
- Old database versions → `Archive/OldVersions/`
- Research tracking CSVs → `Archive/EnrichmentBatches/`
- Planning/analysis docs → `Archive/PlanningDocuments/`
- Finalized section drafts → `Archive/DraftSections/`
- Warlock comparison docs → `Archive/ReferenceAnalysis/`

### What Goes to Other Folders:
- Session summaries → `Documentation/10_SessionSummaries/`
- Implementation guides → `Documentation/06_ProjectDocuments/`
- Analysis reports → `Reports/04_Analysis/`

### Maintenance Workflow:
1. Create new analysis/temporary files as needed
2. When work is complete, move to appropriate Archive/ subfolder
3. Never let root exceed 4 essential files
4. Run `CLEANUP_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.ps1` if folder gets messy

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### Problem:
- **Before**: 41 files in root folder, difficult to find essential files
- **Confusion**: Mix of current, old, draft, and temporary files
- **Risk**: Using outdated information from old versions

### Solution:
- **After**: 4 essential files in root, 36 archived in organized subfolders
- **Clarity**: Immediately clear what's current vs. historical
- **Safety**: Archive preserves history without cluttering root

### User Directive:
> "C:\Users\tenod\source\repos\BG3Mods\Documentation\00_SourcesOfTruth is messy, i want us to work this into the process, it shoudl never get this messy it is our source of truth folder."

**Resolution**: 
- ✅ Established "4 files only" policy
- ✅ Created automated cleanup script
- ✅ Updated README with maintenance guidelines
- ✅ Organized all historical files into logical Archive/ structure

## 🔄 Future Cleanup

If the folder gets messy again:

### Option 1: Manual Cleanup
1. Identify files to keep in root (4 essential files)
2. Move others to appropriate Archive/ subfolders
3. Update README if needed

### Option 2: Automated Cleanup
```powershell
# Preview changes first
.\CLEANUP_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.ps1 -DryRun

# Apply changes
.\CLEANUP_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.ps1
```

**Note**: Update script's file mapping if new file types are created.
