## 📈 **ANALYSIS - RAGE FLOW OVER 5 ROUNDS**

| Round | Starting Rage | Rage Gained | Rage Spent | Ending Rage | Net Change |
|-------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| **1** | 0 | +47 | 0 | **47** | +47 |
| **2** | 47 | +37 | -30 | **54** | +7 |
| **3** | 54 | +28 | -30 | **52** | -2 |
| **4** | 52 | +46 | 0 | **98** | +46 |
| **5** | 98 | +25 | -50 | **73** | -25 |

**Total Rage Generated**: 183 Rage over 5 rounds (avg 36.6 per round)  
**Total Rage Spent**: 110 Rage over 5 rounds (2 Heroic Strikes + 1 Execute)  
**Net Rage**: +73 Rage (73% of max pool remaining)

---

## ✅ **BALANCE ASSESSMENT**

### **✅ PROS (System Working Well)**:

1. **✅ Smooth Ramp-Up**: 
   - Round 1: 47 Rage (can use 1 ability)
   - Round 2-3: 54-52 Rage (steady state with 1 ability per turn)
   - Round 4-5: 98-73 Rage (burst phase with 2 abilities per turn)

2. **✅ Reward for Taking Damage**:
   - Took 64 total damage → Generated ~65 Rage from incoming attacks
   - Aligns with "Warrior gets stronger as fight goes on" fantasy

3. **✅ Never Rage-Starved**:
   - After Round 1, always had 40+ Rage (can cast abilities every turn)
   - No "empty turns" where Warrior is stuck auto-attacking

4. **✅ Never Rage-Capped**:
   - Peaked at 98 Rage (just under 100 cap)
   - System encourages spending Rage rather than hoarding

5. **✅ Execute Timing**:
   - Had 98 Rage when Execute became available (Round 4)
   - Could afford Execute (20) + Heroic Strike (30) in Round 5 burst

---

### **⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUES**:

1. **⚠️ High Rage Pool by End of Combat**:
   - Ended at 73 Rage (73% of max)
   - If combat ends here, Warrior loses 73 Rage to decay
   - **Feels bad** to waste that much resource

2. **⚠️ Rage Decay Punishes Short Combats**:
   - If next combat starts immediately, 73 Rage decays to 0
   - At -5 per turn (your updated rate), takes 14.6 turns = ~1.5 minutes to decay
   - At -10 per turn (old rate), takes 7.3 turns = ~45 seconds to decay

3. **⚠️ Generation Slightly High in Multi-Target**:
   - Taking hits from 3 enemies = +20-30 Rage per round
   - Could snowball in large encounters (5+ enemies)

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Option A: Keep Current Values** ✅ (RECOMMENDED)
- Rage generation feels good (always have resource, never capped)
- Decay rate -5 per turn is reasonable (1.5 min to decay from full)
- Adjust if players report "too much Rage" in testing

### **Option B: Slightly Lower Generation** ⚠️
- Reduce auto-attack Rage to +4-8 (avg 6 instead of 7.5)
- Would end Round 5 at ~60 Rage instead of 73
- Risk: Might feel "Rage-starved" in low-damage phases

### **Option C: Increase Decay Rate** ⚠️
- Change decay to -10 per turn (back to original)
- Faster reset between combats (45 sec vs 1.5 min)
- Risk: Punishes careful/slow players

---

## 📊 **RAGE DECAY COMPARISON**

**Scenario**: Warrior ends combat at 73 Rage, how long to decay to 0?

| Decay Rate | Turns to 0 | Real Time (6 sec/turn) | Player Experience |
|------------|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **-5/turn** (NEW) | 14.6 turns | ~1.5 minutes | Forgiving, encourages quick follow-up fights |
| **-10/turn** (OLD) | 7.3 turns | ~45 seconds | Punishing, forces fast combat chains |
| **-20/turn** | 3.65 turns | ~22 seconds | Very punishing, almost instant reset |

**User Choice: -5 per turn** ✅ Strikes good balance!

---

## 🎯 **FINAL VERDICT**

### **✅ APPROVED VALUES**:
- ✅ **Auto-attack Rage**: +5-10 (avg 7.5) - Balanced
- ✅ **Taking Damage**: +5-15 (avg 10) - Balanced
- ✅ **Charge**: +20 - Good opener
- ✅ **Whirlwind**: +10 - AoE generation
- ✅ **Rage Decay**: **-5 per turn** (user confirmed)

### **⚠️ WATCH IN PLAYTESTING**:
- Large encounters (5+ enemies) - Rage generation might snowball
- Short combats (1-2 rounds) - Warrior might end with too much leftover Rage
- Long exploration (5+ min between fights) - Full decay feels appropriate

---

## 🔧 **FUTURE TUNING LEVERS** (if needed):

If players report "too much Rage":
1. Reduce taking damage generation to +3-10 (avg 6.5)
2. Reduce auto-attack generation to +4-8 (avg 6)
3. Increase decay rate to -8 per turn

If players report "not enough Rage":
1. Increase auto-attack generation to +6-12 (avg 9)
2. Increase taking damage generation to +8-18 (avg 13)
3. Add Rage generation to more abilities (Shield Block, Defensive Stance, etc.)

---

**Simulation Conclusion**: **✅ SYSTEM IS BALANCED** - Current values provide smooth gameplay with no Rage starvation or capping issues. Proceed with confidence!
