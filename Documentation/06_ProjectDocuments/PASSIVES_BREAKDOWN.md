## üéØ LEVEL 1 PASSIVES EXPLAINED

### **Arms: WAR_ARMS_WeaponMastery**

**Based on Blueprint:** "Weapon Mastery" (unlockLevel: 3 in blueprint, moved to L1 as minor version)

**What It Does:**
- ‚úÖ **+1 to Attack Rolls** when wielding a two-handed melee weapon
- ‚úÖ **+1 to Damage Rolls** when wielding a two-handed melee weapon

**BG3 Implementation:**
```
Passive: WAR_ARMS_WeaponMastery
Conditions: Is wielding weapon with "Versatile" or "Two-Handed" property
Effect: AttackRollBonus(1), DamageBonus(1)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Greatswords, Greataxes, Halberds = +1 hit/+1 damage
- Encourages two-handed playstyle from Level 1
- Stacks with Strength modifier and proficiency bonus
- **Example:** Level 1 Arms with 16 STR, Greatsword
  - Base: +5 to hit (STR +3, Prof +2, Mastery +1)
  - Base: 2d6+3 damage ‚Üí **2d6+4** with Mastery

**Blueprint Reference:**
- Full version unlocks at L3: "PASSIVE_VORGX_WAR_ARMS_WEAPONMASTER"
- This L1 version is the same effect, just earlier

### **Fury: WAR_FURY_DualWieldMastery**

**Based on Blueprint Passive:** "Enrage" (unlockLevel: 3 in blueprint, reinterpreted for L1)

**What It Does:**
- ‚úÖ **+2 Rage** generated per melee attack that **hits**
- ‚úÖ Enhances base Rage generation (normally +5 per hit from WAR_RageGeneration)
- ‚úÖ Total: **+7 Rage per hit** (5 base + 2 from mastery)

**BG3 Implementation:**
```
Passive: WAR_FURY_DualWieldMastery
Trigger: OnMeleeAttackHit
Effect: RestoreResource(Rage, 2)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Fury dual-wields = more attacks = more Rage
- Encourages aggressive playstyle
- With dual-wield at L1: Main hand hit (+7 Rage) + off-hand hit (+7 Rage) = **+14 Rage per round**
- Feeds into Fury's high-Rage spender abilities (Rampage costs 40)

**Example Rage Economy:**
- Turn 1: Attack x2 (main + off-hand) = +14 Rage ‚Üí Total: 14 Rage
- Turn 2: Attack x2 = +14 Rage ‚Üí Total: 28 Rage
- Turn 3: Attack x2 = +14 Rage ‚Üí Total: 42 Rage ‚Üí **Can use Rampage (40 Rage)**

**Blueprint Reference:**
- Differs from blueprint "Enrage" (crit-based damage buff)
- This is a **Rage economy passive** to enable dual-wield Rage generation fantasy
- Makes Fury the fastest Rage-generating spec

### **Protection: WAR_PROT_ShieldSpecialization**

**Based on Blueprint:** "Shield Specialization" (unlockLevel: 3 in blueprint, moved to L1)

**What It Does:**
- ‚úÖ **+2 Armor Class (AC)** when wielding a shield
- ‚úÖ Stacks with shield's base +2 AC bonus
- ‚úÖ Total shield AC bonus: **+4 AC** (+2 shield base + 2 specialization)

**BG3 Implementation:**
```
Passive: WAR_PROT_ShieldSpecialization
Conditions: Has shield equipped
Effect: ACBonus(2)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Protection = tank spec
- Starting AC at L1: **21 AC** (17 Splint + 4 shield)
- Highest AC of any Level 1 class in BG3
- Encourages sword-and-board tanking

**Level 1 AC Comparison:**
- Fighter (Chain + Shield): 18 AC (16 + 2)
- Cleric (Chain + Shield): 18 AC (16 + 2)
- **Protection Warrior:** **21 AC** (17 Splint + 2 shield + 2 passive)

**Blueprint Reference:**
- Exact same as blueprint "PASSIVE_VORGX_WAR_PROT_SHIELD_SPEC" (unlockLevel: 3)
- We're just granting it at L1 instead for early identity

## ‚úÖ CONFIRMED IMPLEMENTATION

**Per User Decision:**
1. ‚úÖ Passive names confirmed: WAR_ARMS_WeaponMastery, WAR_FURY_DualWieldMastery, WAR_PROT_ShieldSpecialization
2. ‚úÖ Placeholder UUIDs for SpellLists and SkillLists (will document for later)
3. ‚úÖ Improved Extra Attack at Level 11 (3 attacks like Fighter)
4. ‚úÖ Placeholder UUIDs for SpellLists and SkillLists
5. ‚úÖ ASI only at Level 20 (5 total: 4/8/12/16/20) - user clarified it's a **feat choice**, not automatic

---

## üéì ASI CLARIFICATION

**Important:** User clarified that in BG3, you only get Ability Score Improvement if you **choose the ASI feat** instead of another feat.

**BG3 Feat System:**
- Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20: Player gets **feat choice**
- One option is always "Ability Score Improvement" feat (+2 to one stat or +1 to two stats)
- Other options: Great Weapon Master, Alert, Lucky, etc.

**Progressions.lsx Implementation:**
- Use `AllowImprovement="true"` at levels 4/8/12/16/20
- This enables the feat selection UI
- Player chooses between ASI or combat feats

**Not like D&D where ASI is automatic!**
