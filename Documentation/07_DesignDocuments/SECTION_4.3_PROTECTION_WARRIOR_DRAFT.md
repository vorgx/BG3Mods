# Section [4.3] Protection Warrior - DRAFT

**Template Based On**: Section [4.1] Arms Warrior + [4.2] Fury Warrior (gold standard)

---

## 4.3.1 Identity and Flavor

### WoW Fantasy: Indomitable Guardian

**Core Identity**: An **unbreakable shield-bearer** who thrives on absorbing punishment, turning enemy aggression into powerful counterattacks and protecting allies through crowd control and threat generation.

**Key Themes**:
- **Shield & Heavy Armor Specialist**: **Must** equip a shield in off-hand (cannot dual-wield or use two-handed weapons)
- **Block Mechanic**: Active mitigation through **Shield Block** charges (unique to Protection)
- **Highest Durability**: d12 hit dice (7 HP per level) - tankiest of all 3 specs
- **Threat & Control**: Built-in Taunt at L1, multiple CC abilities, threat generation tools

**BG3 Adaptation**:
- Shield required in off-hand (sword-and-board style)
- Shield Block charges (starts with 1, upgrades to 2 at L5)
- Riposte mechanic (counter-attacks on successful blocks)
- Crowd control specialists (Demoralizing Shout, Shield Charge, Thunder Clap)

---

### Equipment Proficiencies

**Armor**:
- Light Armor ✅
- Medium Armor ✅
- Heavy Armor ✅ (**Protection specialty** - only spec with heavy armor access)

**Weapons**:
- Simple Weapons ✅
- Martial Weapons ✅
- **One-Handed Focus**: Must use one-handed weapon + shield

**Shields**: ✅ **REQUIRED** (Protection identity - cannot function without shield)

---

### Ability Scores

**Hit Dice**: d12 (**7 HP per level**)  
**Rationale**: Tank design—highest durability of all 3 specs (Arms 6 HP/level, Fury 5 HP/level)

**Primary Ability**: **Constitution** (survivability, tank durability)  
**Secondary Ability**: **Strength** (melee weapon attacks, some abilities scale with STR)

**Recommended Starting Array** (Point Buy):
- **CON**: 16-17 (Primary - need HP to tank hits)
- **STR**: 14-16 (Secondary - damage scaling, attack accuracy)
- **DEX**: 10-12 (Medium armor benefits, AC)
- **INT/WIS/CHA**: 8-10 (dump stats)

**Design Note**: Protection is the **only Warrior spec with CON as primary ability score** (Arms/Fury use STR primary). This reflects tank identity—survive first, deal damage second.

---

## 4.3.2 Unique Mechanics

### Block Mechanic (Core Identity)

**Shield Block** (Available from **L3**, upgrades at **L5**):
- **L3**: 1 charge (single use per short rest)
- **L5**: 2 charges (RESOURCE UPGRADE - now 2 uses per short rest)
- **Effect**: Active mitigation—reduce incoming damage by 50-70% for 1 turn (talent-dependent)
- **Philosophy**: Protection's core defensive tool, separates tanks from DPS specs

**Shield Block Enhancements** (via talents):
- **Impenetrable Wall** (L10): Shield Block reduces damage by 70% (up from 50%)
- **Shield Specialization** (L10): Shield Block grants temporary HP
- **Heavy Repercussions** (L8): Shield Block increases next Shield Slam damage

---

### Riposte System (Counter-Attack Specialist)

**Riposte** (Auto-granted at **L3**):
- **Trigger**: When you successfully block an attack
- **Effect**: Immediately counter-attack the attacker (weapon damage)
- **Philosophy**: Rewarding active mitigation with damage output

**Synergy with Talents**:
- **Best Served Cold** (L6): Riposte applies slow debuff
- **Punish** (L8): Riposte generates bonus Rage
- **Heavy Handed** (L11): Riposte deals bonus damage

---

### Shield Slam Enhancement (Tank DPS Tool)

**Shield Slam** (Auto-granted at **L1** - **PROTECTION EXCLUSIVE!**):
- **Effect**: 2d8 + Strength damage, applies armor reduction debuff
- **Rage Cost**: 15 Rage
- **Cooldown**: Once per turn
- **Design Philosophy**: Protection's primary Rage spender, earlier than Arms/Fury (they get it at L12)

**Shield Slam Enhancements** (via talents):
- **Heavy Repercussions** (L8): Shield Slam deals +50% damage after Shield Block
- **Devastator** (L5): Shield Slam resets cooldown on critical hit
- **Punish** (L8): Shield Slam generates bonus Rage on targets with debuffs

---

### Threat Generation & Crowd Control

**Taunt** (Auto-granted at **L1** - earliest of all specs):
- **Effect**: Force enemy to attack you for 2 turns
- **Rage Cost**: 10 Rage
- **Cooldown**: Once per combat

**Shield Block + Riposte** (Auto-granted at **L3**):
- **Shield Block**: Active mitigation (1 charge → 2 charges at L5)
- **Riposte**: Counter-attack on block (passive)

**Crowd Control Options** (via SubclassSpec Talents):
- **Demoralizing Shout** (L4): AoE debuff (enemies deal less damage)
- **Disrupting Shout** (L6): Interrupt all enemies in radius
- **Shield Charge** (L12): Gap closer with stun effect

---

## 4.3.3 Baseline Ability Progression (L1-L12)

**Full Details**: See Section [3.3] Level-by-Level Base Class Features

**Quick Reference Table**:

| Level | Abilities Granted | Total Features at Level |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **L1** | Shield Slam + Taunt | **2 abilities** ✨ (Protection gets offensive + utility from start) |
| **L3** | Devastate + Shield Block + Riposte | **5 features** (2 abilities + 1 resource + 1 passive) |
| **L5** | Heroic Throw + Charge + Shield Block 2nd charge | **9 features** (2 abilities + 1 resource upgrade) |
| **L7** | Slam + Pummel + Vanguard | **12 features** (2 abilities + 1 passive) |
| **L9** | Execute + Victory Rush | **14 features** (2 abilities) |
| **L10** | — | **14 features** (no new abilities) |
| **L11** | Hamstring + Battle Shout | **16 features** (2 abilities) |
| **L12** | Whirlwind | **17 features** (1 ability) |

**Total Baseline Abilities (L1-L12)**: **20 features** (12 offensive + 8 utility)  
**Note**: Protection has **5 more baseline abilities** than Arms/Fury (15 each)

**Key Ability Timing**:
- **Shield Slam**: **L1** ✨ (Protection exclusive - Arms/Fury get at L12, **11 level gap!**)
- **Taunt**: **L1** ✨ (Protection exclusive - Arms/Fury get at L9, **8 level gap!**)
- **Execute**: **L10** (Arms L3, Fury L7 - Protection gets it latest)
- **Whirlwind**: **L12** (Arms/Fury L1 - Protection gets it latest, **11 level gap!**)

**Design Philosophy**: Protection gets core tank toolkit early (Shield Slam + Taunt at L1, Shield Block + Riposte at L3) to enable tanking from character creation. Offensive abilities (Execute, Whirlwind) come much later because tank focus is survival, not damage. Protection has **most baseline abilities** (20 vs 15) because tanks need utility (ranged pull, CC, threat).

---

## 4.3.9 Hero Talent Transition (L13+)

**At Level 13**, Protection Warriors choose between **2 hero talent specializations**:

---

### Mountain Thane (Fury + Protection)

**Theme**: Storm-empowered warrior, Thunder damage, tankier berserker

**Signature Abilities**:
- **Thunder Clap Enhancement** - Thunder Clap becomes primary damage tool
- **Lightning Strikes** - Rage spenders trigger chain lightning
- **Thorim's Might** - All attacks deal Thunder damage
- **Avatar of the Storm** - Transform into lightning-empowered avatar

**Best For**: Protection Warriors who want damage output without sacrificing tankiness, AoE focus, Thor fantasy

**Synergy with Protection Builds**:
- **Shout Master**: Thunder Clap synergy (Thunderlord talent makes Thunder Clap deal bonus damage + Rage)
- **Block Master**: Lightning Strikes chains during Shield Block windows
- **Riposte Specialist**: Thorim's Might provides Thunder damage on Riposte counter-attacks

**Playstyle**: Tank who controls the battlefield with storm powers—still durable, but with significant AoE damage

**Full Details**: See Section [5] Specializations/Hero Classes

---

### Colossus (Arms + Protection)

**Theme**: Immovable object, ground control, area denial specialist

**Signature Abilities**:
- **Demolish** - Ground slam that creates zone of control
- **Colossal Might** - Size increase, melee range increase, knockback on attacks
- **Mountain of Muscle** - Cannot be moved, CC immunity while standing still
- **Earthen Smash** - Throw boulder for massive single-target damage

**Best For**: Protection Warriors who want to control space, be utterly immovable, fantasy of being a walking fortress

**Synergy with Protection Builds**:
- **Block Master**: Mountain of Muscle synergy (cannot be moved while Shield Block active via Unyielding Stance)
- **Immortal Tank**: Colossal Might grants size increase (intimidation factor), knockback control
- **Shield Slam Burst**: Demolish provides ground control, Earthen Smash adds single-target burst

**Playstyle**: Immovable tank who controls key choke points—enemies cannot push you, you create zones of denial

**Full Details**: See Section [5] Specializations/Hero Classes

---

### Design Note: Hero Talents vs. SubclassSpec Talents

**Key Differences**:
- **L1-L12 (SubclassSpec Talents)**: Player makes **9 choices** (Rows 2-10, one per level, but Row 1 auto-granted)
- **L13-L20 (Hero Talents)**: Player makes **1 choice** (Mountain Thane OR Colossus at L13), then receives **8 auto-granted talents** as they level
- **Auto-Grant Philosophy**: Hero talents are pre-designed power spikes, not customizable—this reduces choice complexity at endgame

**Specialization Choice Impact**:
- **Mountain Thane**: More AoE focused, storm/Thunder theme, damage output boost
- **Colossus**: More single-target control, immovable object, space control

**Cannot Change**: Once you choose at L13, you're committed to that hero talent tree for the character's lifetime

---

### Recommendation Guide

**Choose Mountain Thane if you built**:
- Shout Master (Thunderlord talent synergy, Thunder Clap becomes primary tool)
- Riposte Specialist (Thorim's Might adds Thunder damage to counter-attacks)
- Block Master (Lightning Strikes chains during Shield Block windows)
- Want more damage (Mountain Thane provides AoE damage boost without sacrificing tankiness)

**Choose Colossus if you built**:
- Immortal Tank (Mountain of Muscle synergy, literally cannot be moved)
- Block Master (Unyielding Stance + Mountain of Muscle = ultimate immovability)
- Shield Slam Burst (Earthen Smash adds single-target burst, Demolish adds ground control)
- Want space control (Colossus is best for choke point tanking, area denial)

**Both Work With**: Most Protection builds can use either hero talent—choice often comes down to fantasy preference (storm-powered tank vs. immovable fortress)
