## USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS

### Before Enhancement
**Player at L5 picks Die by the Sword**:
- Sees: "Defensive cooldown (parry incoming attacks for 3 turns)"
- Thinks: "This looks useful, but is it a dead-end talent?"
- **Problem**: No visibility into future investment value

### After Enhancement
**Player at L5 picks Die by the Sword**:
- Sees: "Defensive cooldown (parry incoming attacks for 3 turns)"
- Sees: **"Unlocks: Storm Wall (Row 4, L6)"**
- Thinks: "Oh! This unlocks projectile deflection next level—worth the investment!"
- **Result**: Informed decision about talent chain commitment

---

### Before Enhancement
**Player at L7 picks Colossus Smash**:
- Sees: "New ability (armor-breaking strike)"
- Thinks: "Is this just a one-off ability?"
- **Problem**: No visibility into build depth

### After Enhancement
**Player at L7 picks Colossus Smash**:
- Sees: "New ability (armor-breaking strike)"
- Sees: **"Unlocks: Test of Might (Row 7, L9), Warbreaker (Row 7, L9)"**
- Sees Design Philosophy: **"(unlocks 2 talents at L9)"**
- Thinks: "Wow, this opens up TWO enhancement paths at L9—this is a build-defining choice!"
- **Result**: Understands long-term build investment

---

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY UPDATES

**Row 3 (L5)**:
```
Choose between offense (Martial Prowess, Improved Execute) or defense (Die by the Sword). 
Note: Die by the Sword is required for Storm Wall at L6.
```

**Row 5 (L7)**:
```
Choose your "finisher" enhancement—Colossus Smash for armor break (unlocks 2 talents at L9), 
Impale for crit focus, or Tactician for cooldown management (unlocks enhancement at L10).
```

**Row 9 (L11)**:
```
- **New Capstone Abilities**: Bladestorm (unlocks enhancement at L12), Ravager (unlocks enhancement at L12)
```

---

## REPLICATION TO FURY/PROTECTION

**Pattern to Follow**:
1. Identify all prerequisite chains in Fury/Protection talent trees
2. Add **"Unlocks:"** to base talents
3. Add **"Requires:"** to dependent talents
4. Update Design Philosophy notes to mention unlock chains
5. Highlight multi-unlock talents (like Colossus Smash → 2 talents)

**Estimated Time per Spec**: +5 min (beyond base 10 min for prerequisites)

---

## COMPARISON: BEFORE VS. AFTER

### Before (Backward Only)
**Storm Wall** (Row 4, L6):
```
4. **Storm Wall** - Die by the Sword deflects projectiles back to attackers  
   **Requires**: Die by the Sword (Row 3, L5)
```

**Player Experience**: "Oh, I can't pick this without Die by the Sword" (reactive)

---

### After (Bidirectional)
**Die by the Sword** (Row 3, L5):
```
2. **Die by the Sword** - Defensive cooldown (parry incoming attacks for 3 turns)  
   **Unlocks**: Storm Wall (Row 4, L6)
```

**Storm Wall** (Row 4, L6):
```
4. **Storm Wall** - Die by the Sword deflects projectiles back to attackers  
   **Requires**: Die by the Sword (Row 3, L5)
```

**Player Experience**: 
- At L5: "This unlocks Storm Wall—I can plan ahead!" (proactive)
- At L6: "I need Die by the Sword to pick this" (confirmation)

---

## TOOLTIP TAGGING INTEGRATION (FUTURE)

When tooltip tagging is implemented (Section [4.9]), these "Unlocks:" notes will translate to in-game tooltips:

**Example Tooltip - Die by the Sword**:
```
Die by the Sword

Parry incoming attacks, becoming nearly invulnerable for 3 turns.

Action • 60s Cooldown

Tags: Defensive, Survival, Cooldown

Unlocks: Storm Wall (L6)
```

**Result**: Players see unlock information directly in-game during talent selection!
