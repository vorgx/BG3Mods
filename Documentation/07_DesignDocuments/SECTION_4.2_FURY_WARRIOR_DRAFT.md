## 4.2.1 Identity and Flavor

### WoW Fantasy: Relentless Berserker

**Core Identity**: A raging berserker who **dual-wields weapons** with reckless abandon, thriving in extended combat through continuous Enrage states and building rage through a flurry of strikes.

**Key Themes**:
- **Dual-Wielding Specialist**: Can equip weapons in both hands (unlike Arms' two-handed focus or Protection's sword-and-board)
- **Enrage-Driven Combat**: Bers Rage mechanic available from **L1** (earliest of all specs), constantly triggers Enrage for damage bonuses
- **Glass Cannon**: Trades survivability for raw DPS‚Äîmedium armor only, no heavy armor
- **Sustained Fury**: Excels in prolonged fights where Rage generation and Enrage uptime shine

**BG3 Adaptation**:
- Dual-wield combat (one-handed weapons in each hand)
- Berserker Rage grants temporary bonuses (damage, CC immunity, Rage generation)
- Bloodthirst provides self-healing to offset fragility
- Raging Blow, Rampage, and Onslaught provide high-frequency attacks

---

### Equipment Proficiencies

**Armor**:
- Light Armor ‚úÖ
- Medium Armor ‚úÖ
- Heavy Armor ‚ùå (Fury sacrifices protection for mobility and dual-wield speed)

**Weapons**:
- Simple Weapons ‚úÖ
- Martial Weapons ‚úÖ
- **Dual-Wield Focus**: One-handed weapons in each hand (swords, axes, maces)

**Shields**: ‚ùå (cannot use shields‚Äîboth hands needed for dual-wield)

---

### Ability Scores

**Hit Dice**: d8 (**5 HP per level**)  
**Rationale**: Glass cannon design‚Äîlowest durability of all 3 specs (Arms 6 HP/level, Protection 7 HP/level)

**Primary Ability**: **Strength** (melee weapon attacks, damage scaling)  
**Secondary Ability**: **Constitution** (survivability, compensates for medium armor restriction)

**Recommended Starting Array** (Point Buy):
- **STR**: 16-17 (Primary - all attacks scale with STR)
- **CON**: 14-16 (Secondary - need HP to survive as glass cannon)
- **DEX**: 10-12 (Medium armor benefits, initiative)
- **INT/WIS/CHA**: 8-10 (dump stats)

---

## 4.2.2 Unique Mechanics

### Enrage Mechanic (Core Identity)

**Berserker Rage** (Available from **L1**):
- **Unique to Fury**: Arms/Protection get Berserker Rage at L7, Fury gets it immediately at character creation
- **Effect**: Enters Enrage state (bonus damage, CC immunity, generates Rage per turn)
- **Duration**: 3-6 turns (talent-dependent)
- **Philosophy**: Fury identity is built around maintaining Enrage uptime

**Enrage Benefits**:
- +10-20% damage (talent scaling)
- Immunity to crowd control (Fear, Charm, etc.)
- Rage generation per turn (sustains resource economy)
- Synergy with talents (Powerful Enrage, Frenzied Enrage, Recklessness)

---

### Bloodthirst (Self-Sustain Specialist)

**Core Ability**: Fury's signature strike (unlocked at L3 via Row 1 auto-grant)
- **Effect**: Deals 2d8 + Strength damage and **heals self for 2d8 HP**
- **Rage Cost**: 20 Rage
- **Cooldown**: Once per turn
- **Design Philosophy**: Offsets glass cannon fragility with built-in self-healing

---

### Dual-Wield Mastery

**Titan's Grip** (Auto-granted L3):
- Passive bonuses to dual-wield weapon damage
- Enables one-handed weapon in each hand
- Synergy with many Fury talents (Hack and Slash, Single-Minded Fury, Slaughtering Strikes)

---

### Rampage & Onslaught (Execute Specialists)

**Rampage** (Tier 2 Ability - Row 5, L7):
- **Effect**: Multiple rapid strikes, generates Rage, triggers Enrage
- **Philosophy**: Fury's "builder" for extended combat

**Onslaught** (Tier 3 Ability - Row 9, L11):
- **Effect**: Channeled barrage of attacks on single target, massive damage
- **Requirement**: Target must be below 35% HP (or 20% base)
- **Philosophy**: Fury's Execute analog (like Arms' Execute, but sustained channel vs. single strike)

---

## 4.2.3 Baseline Ability Progression (L1-L12)

**Full Details**: See Section [3.3] Level-by-Level Base Class Features

**Quick Reference Table**:

| Level | Abilities Granted | Total Features at Level |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **L1** | Whirlwind + Berserker Rage | 2 abilities + 2 stances (Battle/Defensive - baseline for Fury) = **4 features** |
| **L3** | Charge + Execute | +2 abilities = **6 features** |
| **L5** | Pummel + Slam | +2 abilities = **8 features** |
| **L7** | Hamstring + Battle Shout | +2 abilities = **10 features** |
| **L9** | Taunt + Hamstring | +2 abilities = **12 features** |
| **L11** | Heroic Throw | +1 ability = **13 features** |
| **L12** | Shield Slam | +1 ability = **14 features** |

**Total Baseline Abilities (L1-L12)**: **15 features** (8 offensive + 7 utility)

**Key Ability Timing**:
- **Berserker Rage**: **L1** ‚ú® (earliest of all specs - Fury specialty! Arms/Protection get at L7)
- **Execute**: L3 (same as Arms, earlier than Protection L10)
- **Whirlwind**: L1 (same as Arms, earlier than Protection L12)
- **Shield Slam**: L12 (Protection had at L1 - 11 level gap!)

**Design Philosophy**: Fury gets Berserker Rage immediately (L1) for Enrage identity, Execute early (L3) for burst damage, and acquires utility later (Taunt L9, Heroic Throw L11). Focus is pure offense with self-sustain through Bloodthirst and Enrage healing talents.

---

## 4.2.4 SubclassSpec Talents (Pool 2 - Fury Only)

## 4.2.9 Hero Talent Transition (L13+)

**At Level 13**, Fury Warriors choose between **2 hero talent specializations**:

---

### Mountain Thane (Fury + Protection)

**Signature Abilities**:
- **Thunder Clap Enhancement** - Thunder Clap becomes primary damage tool
- **Lightning Strikes** - Rage spenders trigger chain lightning
- **Thorim's Might** - Enrage grants Thunder damage on all attacks
- **Avatar of the Storm** - Transform into lightning-empowered avatar

**Best For**: Fury Warriors who want tankiness without sacrificing damage, AoE focus, Thor fantasy

**Synergy with Fury Builds**:
- **Rampage Enrage**: Permanent Thunder damage through high Enrage uptime
- **AoE Cleave**: Lightning Strikes chains to multiple enemies during Whirlwind/Bladestorm
- **Bloodthirst Specialist**: Thorim's Might provides consistent Thunder damage on Bloodthirst spam

**Playstyle**: Berserker with storm powers‚Äîless glass cannon, more durable through Protection-themed talents

**Full Details**: See Section [5] Specializations/Hero Classes

---

### Slayer (Arms + Fury)

**Theme**: Execution specialist, ruthless finisher, relentless pursuit of wounded enemies

**Signature Abilities**:
- **Brutal Finish** - Enhanced Execute mechanics with reduced cooldown
- **Culling Strike** - Multi-target execute (Execute can hit multiple low-HP enemies)
- **Slayer's Strike** - Guaranteed crit on Execute
- **Arterial Blows** - Bleeding enemies take massive bonus damage

**Best For**: Fury Warriors who focus on Execute builds, burst damage, assassination fantasy

**Synergy with Fury Builds**:
- **Execute Specialist**: Natural fit‚ÄîOnslaught + Culling Strike = multi-target execution
- **Recklessness Burst**: Slayer's Strike guarantees crits (synergy with Recklessness auto-crit)
- **Bloodthirst Specialist**: Arterial Blows rewards bleeds (Fury has fewer bleed talents, but Class Talents provide options)

**Playstyle**: Hunt wounded enemies relentlessly‚ÄîExecute/Onslaught become your primary tools

**Full Details**: See Section [5] Specializations/Hero Classes

---

### Design Note: Hero Talents vs. SubclassSpec Talents

**Key Differences**:
- **L1-L12 (SubclassSpec Talents)**: Player makes **10 choices** (Rows 3-10, one per level, but Rows 1-2 auto-granted)
- **L13-L20 (Hero Talents)**: Player makes **1 choice** (Mountain Thane OR Slayer at L13), then receives **8 auto-granted talents** as they level
- **Auto-Grant Philosophy**: Hero talents are pre-designed power spikes, not customizable‚Äîthis reduces choice complexity at endgame

**Specialization Choice Impact**:
- **Mountain Thane**: More AoE focused, tankier, storm/Thunder theme
- **Slayer**: More single-target burst, Execute specialist, assassin fantasy

**Cannot Change**: Once you choose at L13, you're committed to that hero talent tree for the character's lifetime

---

### Recommendation Guide

**Choose Mountain Thane if you built**:
- Rampage Enrage (Thorim's Might provides Thunder damage on every attack)
- AoE Cleave (Lightning Strikes chains during Whirlwind/Bladestorm)
- Bloodthirst Specialist (tankier build benefits from Protection-themed survivability)
- Need more durability (Mountain Thane reduces glass cannon fragility)

**Choose Slayer if you built**:
- Execute Specialist (Onslaught + Culling Strike = multi-target execution)
- Recklessness Burst (Slayer's Strike guarantees crits, synergy with Recklessness)
- Dual-Wield Master (Arterial Blows rewards fast attack speed for bleed application)
- Want pure DPS (Slayer is highest single-target burst)

**Both Work With**: Most Fury builds can use either hero talent‚Äîchoice often comes down to fantasy preference (storm berserker vs. relentless executioner)
