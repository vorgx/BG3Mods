## Key Differences

| Aspect | 3-Tier (Colossus, Slayer) | 4-Tier (Mountain Thane) |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Player Choices** | 3 | 4 |
| **Auto-Passives** | 4 | 3 |

| **Complexity** | Lower (simpler synergies) | Higher (complex chains) |
| **Build Variety** | 27 possible combinations (3³) | 81 possible combinations (3⁴) |

---

## Power Budget

Both systems target **~125% power increase** over L13-L20:

### 3-Tier Breakdown
- Keystone: 25%
- Capstone: 25%
- 3 Choices: 15% each = 45%
- 4 Passives: 7.5% each = 30%
- **Total**: 125%

### 4-Tier Breakdown
- Keystone: 25%
- Capstone: 25%
- 4 Choices: 12% each = 48%
- 3 Passives: 9% each = 27%
- **Total**: 125%

**Balance principle**: More choices = slightly lower power per choice, but same total power.

---

## Player Experience

### 3-Tier Specializations
**Pacing**: Relaxed decision-making
- Level up → Get passive → Wait 2 levels → Make choice
- Choices feel more impactful (bigger power jumps)
- Easier to understand for new players

**Example Player Journey** (Colossus):
```
L13: "Wow, I got Demolish! This is awesome!"
L14: "Cool, more tankiness (Colossal Endurance)"
L15: "Big decision time! Do I want more damage (Boneshaker), stacking buff (Colossal Might), or defense (One-Handed Spec)?"
L16: "Nice, Shield Mastery makes me tankier"
L17: "Another choice! Bleed (Arterial), attack speed (Practiced), or CC (Unstoppable)?"
L18: "Demolishing Charge makes Charge even better!"
L19: "Final choice! AoE (Earthquaker), mitigation (Walls), or HP (Mountain)?"
L20: "Rage generation! I'm complete!"
```

---

### 4-Tier Specializations
**Pacing**: Frequent decision-making
- Level up → Get passive → Choose TWICE in a row → Wait → Choose TWICE in a row
- Choices feel more granular (smaller power increments)
- Rewards theory-crafting and planning ahead

**Example Player Journey** (Mountain Thane):
```
L13: "Avatar of the Storm! Lightning theme!"
L14: "Thunder Clap bonus (Crashing Thunder)"
L15: "Choice 1! Lightning procs (Lightning Strikes), TC upgrade (Thunder Blast), or mobility (Crashing Wave)?"
L16: "Choice 2 immediately! Now I pick sustain (Storm Forge), damage (Thunderous Blows), or chain (Ground Current)?"
L17: "Passive break - +4 STR during Avatar (Thorim's Might)"
L18: "Choice 3! Core ability upgrade (Burst), CDR (TC CDR), or spread (Lightning Chains)?"
L19: "Choice 4 immediately! Avatar extension (Avatar Duration), proc upgrade (Storm Strikes), or utility (Thunder Shout)?"
L20: "Final passive (Storm's Eye) - build complete!"
```
