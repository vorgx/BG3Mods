## üéØ How This Translates to Database

### ‚úÖ **AUTO-GRANTED BASELINE ABILITIES**

These get unlock levels populated:

| Ability Name | warrior_unlock | arms_unlock | fury_unlock | protection_unlock | Reason |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Execute** | **(empty)** | **3** | **(empty)** | **(empty)** | Only Arms gets it at L3 (Fury gets at L7, Prot at L10) |
| **Pummel** | **(empty)** | **3** | **(empty)** | **(empty)** | Only Arms gets it at L3 (Fury gets at L5, Prot at L7) |
| **Devastate** | **(empty)** | **(empty)** | **(empty)** | **3** | Protection-only baseline ability |
| **Shield Block** | **(empty)** | **(empty)** | **(empty)** | **3** | Protection-only baseline ability |
| **Riposte** | **(empty)** | **(empty)** | **(empty)** | **3** | Protection-only baseline ability |
| **Slam** | **(empty)** | **(empty)** | **3** | **(empty)** | Only Fury gets it at L3 (Arms/Prot get at L7) |
| **Charge** | **(empty)** | **(empty)** | **3** | **(empty)** | Only Fury gets it at L3 (Arms gets at L1, Prot at L5) |

### ‚ùå **TALENT CHOICES - NOT POPULATED YET**

These are player choices, not auto-granted, so unlock levels need different handling:

| Ability Name | Type | Notes |
|--------------|------|-------|
| Impending Victory | Class Talent | Player choice at L3 |
| Heroic Leap | Class Talent | Player choice at L3 |
| Storm Bolt | Class Talent | Player choice at L3 |
| Martial Prowess | Arms Spec Talent | Player choice at L3 |
| Die by the Sword | Arms Spec Talent | Player choice at L3 |
| Improved Execute | Arms Spec Talent | Player choice at L3 |
| Frenzied Enrage | Fury Spec Talent | Player choice at L3 |
| Powerful Enrage | Fury Spec Talent | Player choice at L3 |
| Enraged Regeneration | Fury Spec Talent | Player choice at L3 |
| Improved Execute (Fury) | Fury Spec Talent | Player choice at L3 |
| Brace For Impact | Prot Spec Talent | Player choice at L3 |
| Armor Specialization | Prot Spec Talent | Player choice at L3 |
| Fight Through the Flames | Prot Spec Talent | Player choice at L3 |
| Devastator | Prot Spec Talent | Player choice at L3 |

**Question**: Should talent choices also get unlock levels? Or only auto-granted abilities?

## üîç **Key Observations**

### 1. **Execute Appears Multiple Times**
- Arms gets "Execute" at L3
- Fury gets "Execute" at L7
- Protection gets "Execute" at L10
- **Result**: `warrior_unlock = (empty)` because different levels
- Each spec column gets its own level: `arms_unlock = 3, fury_unlock = 7, protection_unlock = 10`

### 2. **Charge Appears Multiple Times**
- Arms gets "Charge" at L1
- Fury gets "Charge" at L3
- Protection gets "Charge" at L5
- **Result**: `warrior_unlock = (empty)` because different levels
- Each spec column gets its own level: `arms_unlock = 1, fury_unlock = 3, protection_unlock = 5`

### 3. **Pummel Appears Multiple Times**
- Arms gets "Pummel" at L3
- Fury gets "Pummel" at L5
- Protection gets "Pummel" at L7
- **Result**: `warrior_unlock = (empty)` because different levels
- Each spec column gets its own level: `arms_unlock = 3, fury_unlock = 5, protection_unlock = 7`

### 4. **Some Abilities Are Spec-Exclusive**
- "Devastate" only appears in Protection column
- "Shield Block" only appears in Protection column
- "Riposte" only appears in Protection column
- **Result**: `warrior_unlock = (empty)`, `arms_unlock = (empty)`, `fury_unlock = (empty)`, `protection_unlock = 3`

## ü§î **Questions for User**

### Q1: Talent Choices
**Should talent choice abilities also get unlock levels?**
- ‚úÖ **YES**: Populate unlock level when talent becomes AVAILABLE (even if not auto-granted)
- ‚ùå **NO**: Only populate unlock levels for AUTO-GRANTED abilities

**Current assumption**: Only populate AUTO-GRANTED abilities (baseline + Row 1/2 auto-grants)

### Q2: warrior_unlock Logic
**When should `warrior_unlock` be populated?**

**Option A** (Current understanding):
- Only when ALL specs get the ability at the SAME level
- Example: Battle Stance (all get at L1) ‚Üí `warrior_unlock = 1`
- Example: Execute (different levels) ‚Üí `warrior_unlock = (empty)`

**Option B** (Alternative):
- Never populate `warrior_unlock` at all (use only spec-specific columns)

**Current assumption**: Option A

## üìã **Script Behavior for Level 3**

```powershell
# Parsing Level 3 row from CSV

# Arms baseline abilities
Add to database:
  Execute:  arms_unlock = 3
  Pummel:   arms_unlock = 3

# Protection baseline abilities
Add to database:
  Devastate:     protection_unlock = 3
  Shield Block:  protection_unlock = 3
  Riposte:       protection_unlock = 3

# Fury baseline abilities
Add to database:
  Slam:    fury_unlock = 3
  Charge:  fury_unlock = 3 (also update earlier Arms entry: arms_unlock = 1)

# Class talent choices (skip for now - not auto-granted)
Skip: Impending Victory, Heroic Leap, Storm Bolt

# Spec talent choices (skip for now - not auto-granted)
Skip: All Arms/Fury/Protection spec talent choices
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Expected Database Updates After Processing L3**

| Ability | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Execute | `arms_unlock = ''` | `arms_unlock = 3` |
| Pummel | `arms_unlock = ''` | `arms_unlock = 3` |
| Devastate | `protection_unlock = ''` | `protection_unlock = 3` |
| Shield Block | `protection_unlock = ''` | `protection_unlock = 3` |
| Riposte | `protection_unlock = ''` | `protection_unlock = 3` |
| Slam | `fury_unlock = ''` | `fury_unlock = 3` |
| Charge | `arms_unlock = '', fury_unlock = ''` | `arms_unlock = 1, fury_unlock = 3` (L1 from earlier row) |

---

## üéØ **Is This the Expected Behavior?**

Please confirm:
1. ‚úÖ Only auto-granted baseline abilities get unlock levels (not talent choices)
2. ‚úÖ `warrior_unlock` stays empty unless ALL specs get at SAME level
3. ‚úÖ Each spec column gets its unlock level even if different from others
4. ‚úÖ Abilities appearing at multiple levels get ALL levels recorded (e.g., Charge at L1/L3/L5)

**Waiting for confirmation before finalizing script logic!** üö¶
