### ✅ Improvement 2: Talent Prerequisites (10 min)

**Locations**: Rows 4, 7, 8, 10

**Prerequisites Added**:

**Row 4 (L6)**:

- **Dance of Death** → **Requires**: Bladestorm (Row 9, L11)
- **Merciless Bonegrinder** → **Requires**: Ravager (Row 9, L11)

**Total Prerequisites**: 6 dependent talents now clearly marked

**Impact**: Clarifies talent chains, prevents "dead talent" picks (choosing enhancement without base ability), helps with build planning.

---

### ✅ Improvement 3: Hero Talent Transition Preview (10 min)

**Location**: New subsection 4.1.9 after Validation Checklist (before Section [4.2])

**Content Added**:

**Colossus (Arms + Protection)**:
- Theme: Titan-themed strength, devastating power strikes
- Signature Abilities: Colossal Might, Demolish, Ground Current, Avatar of the Storm
- Best For: Execute builds, single-target burst, boss damage
- Synergy: Execute Master, Colossus Smash Build, Tank Hybrid
- Playstyle: Titan on battlefield—crushing strikes

**Slayer (Arms + Fury)**:
- Theme: Execution specialist, ruthless finisher
- Signature Abilities: Brutal Finish, Culling Strike, Slayer's Strike, Arterial Blows
- Best For: Execute builds, cleave damage, bleed builds
- Synergy: Execute Master, Bleed Specialist, AoE Specialist, Overpower Specialist
- Playstyle: Hunt wounded enemies—Execute becomes primary tool

**Design Note Section**:
- Explained difference between L1-L12 choices (10 player choices) vs. L13-L20 (1 choice at L13, then 8 auto-grants)
- Auto-grant philosophy: Reduces choice complexity at endgame
- Cannot change hero talent after L13 choice

**Recommendation Guide**:
- Choose Colossus: Execute Master, Colossus Smash Build, Tank Hybrid
- Choose Slayer: Execute Master (double down), Bleed Specialist, AoE Specialist, Overpower Specialist
- Both work with most builds—often fantasy preference (titan vs. assassin)

**Impact**: Provides natural transition from L1-L12 → L13-L20, shows how hero talents complement SubclassSpec choices, helps players plan builds with L13+ in mind.
