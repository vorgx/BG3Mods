## üîç Key Data Points

### Total Baseline Abilities by Subclass (L1-L10)
- **Protection**: 17 features (tank support requires extra utility)
- **Arms**: 13 features (balanced offense + utility)
- **Fury**: 13 features (balanced offense + sustain)

### Critical Ability Timing Gaps
| Ability | Arms | Protection | Fury | Gap (Max) |
|---------|------|-----------|------|-----------|
| **Execute** | L3 ‚ú® | L9 | L7 | 6 levels (Arms vs. Protection) |
| **Berserker Rage** | L7 | L12 | L1 ‚ú® | 11 levels (Fury vs. Protection) |
| **Taunt** | L9 | L1 ‚ú® | L9 | 8 levels (Protection vs. DPS specs) |
| **Shield Slam** | L12 | L1 ‚ú® | L12 | 11 levels (Protection vs. DPS specs) |
| **Whirlwind** | L1 ‚ú® | L12 | L1 ‚ú® | 11 levels (DPS specs vs. Protection) |

### Talent Choices (L1-L10)
- **Class Talents**: 9 choices (Row 2-10) + 1 auto-grant (Row 1)
- **SubclassSpec Talents**: 8 choices (Row 1-8) + 2 more at L11-L12 (Rows 9-10, outside draft scope)
- **Feats**: 2 choices (L4, L8)
- **TOTAL**: 19 choices (EXCLUDING hero talents at L13-20)

### Stance Source Distinction (Critical Design Detail)
- **Arms/Protection**: Stances from **Class Talents Row 1** (auto-granted at L1)
- **Fury**: Stances as **Baseline Abilities** (part of subclass identity at L1)
- **All specs**: Get stances auto-granted, just from different sources

## üéØ WoWWarlock Framework Alignment

**Validation Results** (from SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_VALIDATION_REPORT.md):

| Section | Alignment % | Key Findings |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **[1] Overview** | 100% | Perfect template inheritance, enhanced with 12-class vision |
| **[2] Meta Information** | 100% | Exact match: UUID format, 13 dependencies, folder naming, Scripts node |
| **[3.1] Base Class Definition** | 100% | Perfect structural match: BaseHp (10), PrimaryAbility (Strength), ProgressionTableUUID, ParentGuid pattern |
| **[3.2] Core Mechanics** | 95% | Parallel structure, intentional differences: Rage decay (-5 vs. none), resource scale (6 Warrior vs. 1 Warlock secondary) |
| **[3.3] Level-by-Level Features** | N/A | New content (Warlock template doesn't have this level of detail) |

**Conclusion**: Section [3] perfectly follows WoWWarlock template's foundational structure while adding Warrior-specific enhancements (detailed level-by-level breakdown, ability timing comparison, talent choice tracking).

## üí° Key Lessons Learned

### Design Insights
1. **Stance Source Matters**: Fury's stances as baseline abilities (vs. Class Row 1 for Arms/Protection) is a critical design distinction that needed explicit documentation
2. **Two Row Systems Confusing**: Class Talents and SubclassSpec Talents both use Row 1-10 numbering, causing potential confusion - needed comprehensive explanation
3. **Auto-Grant vs. Choice**: Row 1 auto-grant needed explicit clarification to prevent players expecting a choice at L1

### Documentation Process
1. **Validate Before Insertion**: Running comprehensive validation caught 3 fixes before insertion (prevented rework)
2. **Visual Mockups Effective**: Showing before/after comparisons helped user make confident improvement decisions
3. **Source of Truth Protocol Critical**: Following pre-change/post-change protocol kept documentation in sync
4. **Excel as Source of Truth**: Always verify draft content against Excel source to catch discrepancies (stance source distinction found this way)

### Collaboration Patterns
1. **User Corrections Valuable**: User's "Fury needs to be part of this" correction prevented misleading documentation
2. **Iterative Improvements Work**: Draft ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Improve ‚Üí Apply pattern produced high-quality result
3. **Explicit Approval Required**: Never skip user approval for improvements (even "obvious" ones)
