# Warrior Progression LINKED.csv - Complete Analysis

**‚ö†Ô∏è OUTDATED - See HERO_TALENTS_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md for current information**

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: October 23, 2025 (OUTDATED - references old "LINKED.csv" file with 26 hero talents)  
**Replacement Document**: `HERO_TALENTS_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` (33/33 hero talents, "LINKED - Main.csv" file)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation of the LINKED CSV structure and its relationship to AbilityDatabase

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE**: This document references the wrong file ("Warrior Progression LINKED.csv") and outdated hero talent counts (26 instead of 33). The current source of truth is **"Warrior Progression LINKED - Main.csv"** with all 33 hero talents (11 per tree). See `HERO_TALENTS_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` for up-to-date information.

2. **Row 2 (Subheader)**: **Grant method** - "Auto Grant", "Choose one for this per level", "Pick one for this level"

### Column 1-2: Metadata

### Count Comparison

| Hero Tree | In Database | In LINKED.csv | Missing in LINKED.csv |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Mountain Thane | 15 | 9 | 6 |
| Colossus | 5 | 9 | -4 (overlap with Mountain Thane?) |
| Slayer | 13 | 3 | 10 |
| **TOTAL** | **33** | **26** | **7** |

- No Stranger to Pain (in database as Mountain Thane, but appears in Colossus column in LINKED.csv)
- Mountain of Muscle and Scars (in database as Mountain Thane, but appears in Colossus column in LINKED.csv)

**Colossus (theoretically 0 missing, but discrepancy exists)**:
- Database has 5 Colossus talents
- LINKED.csv has 9 talents in Colossus columns

## üîó Relationship to AbilityDatabase

### Database Structure

**File**: `AbilityDatabase_Warrior_FullyEnriched.csv`  
**Columns**: 30 (ability_id, ability_name, description, implementation details, etc.)  
**Total Abilities**: 224 (includes 33 hero talents)

### Linking Mechanism

**LINKED.csv format**: `"Ability Name - ability_id"` (e.g., `"Whirlwind - WAR__Whirlwind_"`)

**Query Pattern for FILE 12 Transformation**:
1. Read LINKED.csv by level (rows 4-23 = levels 1-20)
2. Extract `ability_id` from each cell using regex: `- (WAR[_\w]+)$`
3. Look up `ability_id` in AbilityDatabase for full details:
   - `ability_name` (display name)
   - `bg3_file_type` (Spell_Target.txt, Passive.txt, etc.)
   - `bg3_spell_type` (Target, Zone, Shout, etc.)
   - `implementation_notes` (BG3 conversion guidance)
   - `archetype_tags` (for filtering/grouping)
4. Generate Progressions.lsx XML nodes with full ability data

### Coverage Validation

‚úÖ **100% Coverage**: All 213 ability_id references in LINKED.csv exist in AbilityDatabase  
‚úÖ **No Missing Abilities**: Zero LINKED abilities are missing from database  
‚úÖ **Database Integrity**: Zero duplicates in AbilityDatabase

---

## üéØ Key Insights for FILE 12 Transformation

### 1. **Auto Grant vs. Choice Nodes**

**Auto Grant** (Row 2 = "Auto Grant" or "Auto Granted"):
- Abilities automatically added to character at specific level
- No player choice required
- Examples: Baseline abilities, Stances, Hero Talents

**Choice Nodes** (Row 2 = "Choose one for this per level" or "Pick one for this level"):
- Player picks 1 ability per level from available options
- Requires UI selection during level-up
- Examples: Warrior_Class (columns 14-21), Arms_Subclass (columns 26-34)

### 2. **Hero Talent Structure (L13-20)**

**Pattern**:
- **L13**: Keystone passive (unlocks hero talent tree)
- **L15/L17/L19**: Choice nodes (3 paths, pick 1 per level)
- **L20**: Capstone ability (ultimate talent)

**Implementation**:
- All hero talents are "Auto Granted" (not choice nodes)
- Player chooses hero tree at L13, then automatically receives talents at L15/17/19/20
- Hero trees are **spec-gated**: Mountain Thane (Protection/Fury), Colossus (Arms/Protection), Slayer (Arms/Fury)

### 3. **Column Grouping Strategy**

When transforming to Progressions.lsx, group abilities by **Row 1 Header** (progression track):
- Baseline abilities ‚Üí AddSpells node
- Warrior_Class ‚Üí SelectSpells node (choice)
- Arms_Subclass ‚Üí Conditional AddSpells (if Arms spec)
- Hero Talents ‚Üí Conditional AddPassives (if hero tree selected)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Recommendations

### Issue 1: Slayer Tree Underpopulated
**Problem**: Only 3 Slayer talents in LINKED.csv (vs. 13 in database)  
**Impact**: Hero talent progression for Slayer tree is incomplete  
**Recommendation**: Review original "Warrior Progression for all subclasses and Default hero structure.csv" to find missing Slayer talents and add them to LINKED.csv

### Issue 2: Hero Talent Overlap (Mountain Thane vs. Colossus)
**Problem**: 4 talents (Earthquake, Arterial Bleed, Tide of Battle, No Stranger to Pain, Mountain of Muscle and Scars) appear in Colossus columns but are tagged as Mountain Thane in database  
**Impact**: Ambiguity in which tree owns these talents  
**Recommendation**: Clarify hero tree assignments - either update database tags or fix LINKED.csv column placement

### Issue 3: Missing Keystones & Capstones
**Problem**: L13 keystones and L20 capstones are missing from LINKED.csv for all 3 hero trees  
**Impact**: Hero talent progression incomplete (no entry point at L13, no ultimate at L20)  
**Recommendation**: Add keystone and capstone rows to LINKED.csv columns 54, 58, 59, 63, 64, 68
