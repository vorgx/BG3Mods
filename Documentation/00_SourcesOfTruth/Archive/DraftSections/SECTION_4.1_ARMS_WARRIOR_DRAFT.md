### [4.1] Arms Warrior

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Last Updated**: October 20, 2025

---

#### 4.1.1 Subclass Identity

**Flavor**: Arms Warriors are disciplined weapon masters who wield massive two-handed weapons with lethal precision. They excel at executing wounded foes, applying crippling wounds, and breaking enemy armor with devastating strikes. Arms Warriors favor calculated, high-impact attacks over frenetic rage.

**Core Concept**: Two-handed weapon specialist focused on precise, powerful strikes with execution mechanics.

**Equipment**:
- **Primary Weapons**: Two-handed swords, axes, maces, polearms
- **Armor**: Heavy armor (plate mail, full plate)
- **Special**: Can use shields situationally (unlike Fury)

**Ability Scores** (from Section [1]):
- **Primary**: Strength (damage, to-hit)
- **Secondary**: Constitution (durability)
- **Hit Dice**: d10 (5 HP per level)

**WoW Fantasy**: The Arms Warrior is a battle-hardened veteran who strikes with surgical precision. Every swing of their massive blade is intended to cripple, bleed, or execute. They are the embodiment of controlled fury—patient, tactical, and utterly lethal.

#### 4.1.2 Unique Mechanics

**Mastery: Deep Wounds** (Auto-granted at L3)
- **Effect**: Critical hits with melee attacks apply a bleeding wound that deals 1d4 slashing damage per turn for 6 turns
- **Stacking**: Multiple crits refresh duration
- **Synergy**: Works with all melee attacks (baseline abilities, spec abilities, even basic attacks)

**Mortal Strike Mechanic**
- **Core Ability**: Arms' signature strike (unlocked at L3 via Row 1 auto-grant)
- **Effect**: Deals 2d12 + Strength damage and applies **Mortal Wounds** debuff
- **Mortal Wounds**: Reduces target's healing received by 50% for 6 turns
- **Anti-Heal Specialty**: Makes Arms excellent against regenerating enemies

**Execute Specialist**
- **Early Access**: Arms gets Execute at **L3** (Fury L7, Protection L10)
- **Enhancement Options**: Multiple SubclassSpec Talents improve Execute (Improved Execute, Sudden Death, Executioner's Precision)
- **Design Philosophy**: Arms is THE execution specialist—rewards finishing wounded enemies

**Two-Handed Weapon Focus**
- **Seasoned Soldier** (Auto-granted L3): Passive bonuses to two-handed weapon damage
- **Talent Synergies**: Many Arms talents boost two-handed weapon attacks (Martial Prowess, Strength of Arms)
- **No Dual-Wield**: Arms cannot dual-wield (unlike Fury)

#### 4.1.3 Baseline Ability Progression (L1-L12)

**Full Details**: See Section [3.3] Level-by-Level Base Class Features

**Quick Reference Table**:

| Level | Abilities Granted | Total Features at Level |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **L1** | Whirlwind + Charge | 2 abilities + 2 stances (Battle/Defensive from Class Talents Row 1) = **4 features** |
| **L3** | Execute + Pummel | +2 abilities = **6 features** |
| **L5** | Hamstring + Battle Shout | +2 abilities = **8 features** |
| **L7** | Slam + Berserker Rage | +2 abilities = **10 features** |
| **L9** | Victory Rush + Taunt | +2 abilities = **12 features** |
| **L11** | Heroic Throw | +1 ability = **13 features** |
| **L12** | Shield Slam | +1 ability = **14 features** |

**Total Baseline Abilities (L1-L12)**: **15 features** (8 offensive + 7 utility)

**Key Ability Timing**:
- **Execute**: L3 ✨ (earliest of all specs - Arms specialty!)
- **Berserker Rage**: L7 (Fury had at L1)
- **Taunt**: L9 (Protection had at L1)
- **Shield Slam**: L12 (Protection had at L1 - 11 level gap!)

**Design Philosophy**: Arms gets offensive abilities early (Execute L3, Whirlwind L1) for aggressive DPS focus, but utility abilities come later (Taunt L9, Heroic Throw L11) as Arms is less concerned with threat management than Protection.
