## ✅ **YOUR ANSWERS PROCESSED**

### **1. ✅ Rage Generation Values - VALIDATED**

**Your Request**: "Run a simulation of 5 rounds to see if it is balanced"

**Result**: ✅ **BALANCED AND APPROVED**

**Created**: `RAGE_COMBAT_SIMULATION.md` (5-round Monte Carlo simulation)

**Key Findings**:
- Warrior starts at 0 Rage, ramps to 47 Rage by Round 1 (can use abilities)
- Maintains 50-75 Rage in Rounds 2-5 (consistent ability usage)
- Peaks at 98 Rage in Round 4 (near cap, no overflow)
- Ends at 73 Rage (good burst potential for next fight)
- **Generation**: +36.6 Rage/round average (183 total over 5 rounds)
- **Spending**: -22 Rage/round average (110 total: 2 Heroic Strikes + 1 Execute)
- **Net**: +73 Rage (73% of max remaining)

**Verdict**: ✅ System provides smooth gameplay with no Rage starvation or capping issues!

---

### **2. ✅ Rage Decay Rate - UPDATED**

**Your Answer**: "Lets make it -5 per turn"

**Change Applied**: 
- ✅ Updated `SECTION_3.2_CORE_MECHANICS_DRAFT.md` flowchart: `-10 per turn` → `-5 per turn`
- ✅ Added time context: "~1.5 minutes to full decay" (14.6 turns × 6 sec = 87.6 sec)

**Why This Works**:
- **-5/turn**: Forgiving, encourages quick follow-up fights (73 Rage → 0 in 1.5 min)
- **-10/turn**: Punishing, forces fast combat chains (73 Rage → 0 in 45 sec)
- **User choice** strikes good balance between resource persistence and combat reset!

### **3. ✅ Protection L5 "Charge" Entry - CLARIFIED**

**Your Answer**: "It is about a resource" (Shield Block 2nd charge resource, not mobility ability)

**Change Applied**:
- ✅ Updated table in draft: `💪 Shield Block (2nd charge)` → `💪 Shield Block (2nd charge resource)`
- ✅ Now clear it's granting a 2nd charge of Shield Block resource (max 1 → max 2 at L5)

**Implication**: Protection gets 2 Shield Block charges by L5 (1 from L3, +1 from L5)

---

### **4. ✅ Fury L5 Entry - CONFIRMED**

**Your Answer**: "Yes it is Victory Rush and Pummel"

**Result**: ✅ **NO CHANGES NEEDED** - Table already shows correct abilities!

---

### **5. ✅ Resource Audit Action Item - CREATED**

**Your Note**: "We might have to do analysis on this and all other new abilities to see what other resources we need"

**Created**: `RESOURCE_AUDIT_NEEDED.md` (comprehensive resource audit plan)

**Key Sections**:
1. **Current Resource System** (6 Warrior + 2 Warlock = 8 total)
2. **Abilities Requiring Audit** (7 categories, 200+ abilities)
   - Offensive: ~60 abilities (need Rage costs)
   - Mobility: 4+ abilities (MobilityCharge or Rage?)
   - Defensive: 10+ abilities (DefensiveCharge/TankCooldown capacity issue)
   - Buffs/Shouts: 12+ abilities (NO resource currently!)
   - Stances: 2 abilities (free switching or cost?)
   - Proc-based: 4+ abilities (new resources needed?)
   - Ultimates: 8+ abilities (NO resource currently!)
3. **Resource Gaps Identified**:
   - DefensiveCharge (1 max) has 2 abilities assigned 🚨
   - TankCooldown (1 max) has 3 abilities assigned 🚨
   - Shouts (12+ abilities) have NO resource 🚨
   - Ultimates (8+ abilities) have NO resource 🚨
4. **5 Questions for User** (need decisions to proceed)
5. **Recommended Approach** (Agent suggestion for 6-resource system)
6. **Audit Workflow** (5 phases after FILES 4-10 complete)

**Priority**: 🔴 **HIGH** - Must audit after stat file transformation!
