# Resource System Audit - Action Required After FILES 4-10

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PENDING** - Complete after stat file transformation  
**Source**: `EXCEL_ABILITY_COUNT_SUMMARY.md` (200+ abilities identified)  
**Current Resources**: 6 Warrior + 2 Warlock (8 total)

---

## üö® **WHY THIS AUDIT IS CRITICAL**

**Discovery**: Excel analysis revealed **200+ abilities/passives/talents** across the Warrior class, far more than initially estimated!

**Problem**: Current resource system was designed for ~50-100 abilities. With 200+ abilities, we need to verify:
1. ‚úÖ **Rage costs** are balanced across 60+ offensive abilities
2. ‚úÖ **Charge resources** correctly assigned to mobility/defensive abilities
3. ‚úÖ **New resources** may be needed for ability categories we haven't considered
4. ‚úÖ **Cooldown types** appropriate for each ability (OncePerTurn, OncePerShortRest, OncePerCombat)

---

## üìä **CURRENT RESOURCE SYSTEM** (From CHARGE_RESOURCES_DEEP_DIVE.md)

| Resource Name | Max | Replenish | Used By | Abilities Assigned | Status |
|---------------|-----|-----------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| **Rage** | 100 | Never (combat-only, -5 decay) | All offensive abilities | ~60 abilities | ‚úÖ **Validated** (see RAGE_COMBAT_SIMULATION.md) |
| **MobilityCharge** | 2 | Short Rest | Charge, Heroic Leap, Intervene, Storm Bolt | 4 abilities | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Verify** - Are there more mobility abilities in Excel? |
| **DefensiveCharge** | 1 | Long Rest | Die by the Sword, Berserker Rage | 2 abilities | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Verify** - Protection has many defensive CDs |
| **TankCooldown** | 1 | Long Rest | Last Stand, Shield Wall, Indomitable | 3 abilities | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Verify** - Only 1 charge for 3 abilities? |
| **OverpowerCharge** | 2 | Never (proc-based) | Overpower (Arms) | 1 ability | ‚úÖ **Verified** - Proc from dodge/parry |
| **ThunderCharge** | 3 | Never (proc-based) | Thunder Clap (empowered) | 1 ability | ‚úÖ **Verified** - Proc from Shield Slam |

---

## üéØ **RESOURCE AUDIT WORKFLOW** (After FILES 4-10 Complete)

### **Phase 1: Categorize All Abilities** ‚úÖ

1. ‚úÖ Read all `Spell_*.txt` files in `Data/Public/.../Stats/Generated/Data/`
2. ‚úÖ Read `Passive.txt` for passive effects
3. ‚úÖ Create spreadsheet: Ability Name | Type | Excel Source | Current Resource | Proposed Resource
4. ‚úÖ Flag abilities with NO resource assignment

### **Phase 2: Identify Resource Gaps** ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Count abilities per resource (e.g., "20 abilities use DefensiveCharge but max is 1")
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Identify new resource needs (e.g., "ShoutCharge doesn't exist but 12 shouts need it")
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Flag resource max value mismatches (e.g., "TankCooldown max 1, but 3 abilities assigned")

### **Phase 3: Design New Resources** üöß

For each gap, decide:
- **Resource Name** (e.g., ShoutCharge, UltimateCharge)
- **Max Value** (1-5 range typical)
- **Replenish Type** (Never, Short Rest, Long Rest, Combat)
- **Unlock Level** (when does player get this resource?)
- **Abilities Assigned** (which abilities use this resource?)

### **Phase 4: Update ActionResourceDefinitions.lsx** üöß

1. üöß Add new resource nodes to `ActionResourceDefinitions.lsx`
2. üöß Update Progressions.lsx to grant new resources at appropriate levels
3. üöß Update all affected `Spell_*.txt` entries with new UseCosts
4. üöß Test in-game to verify resource display and functionality

### **Phase 5: Balance Validation** üöß

1. üöß Run combat simulations with new resources (like RAGE_COMBAT_SIMULATION.md)
2. üöß Verify no resource starvation (always have resources to use abilities)
3. üöß Verify no resource overflow (never hit max and waste generation)
4. üöß Adjust max values or replenish rates as needed

## üìã **QUESTIONS FOR USER** (Need Answers to Proceed)

### **Question 1: Defensive Abilities**
DefensiveCharge (1 max) has 2 abilities, TankCooldown (1 max) has 3 abilities, plus 8+ more defensive abilities in Excel.

**What should we do?**
- A) Increase DefensiveCharge max to 3, TankCooldown max to 3
- B) Merge into single DefensiveCooldown (max 5, Long Rest)
- C) Use Rage costs + cooldowns (e.g., -20 Rage + OncePerShortRest)
- D) Other solution?

### **Question 2: Shout Abilities**
12+ shout abilities in Excel, currently NO resource assigned.

**What should we do?**
- A) Create ShoutCharge resource (max 2-3, Short Rest)
- B) Use Rage costs (e.g., -20 Rage per shout)
- C) Use cooldowns only (OncePerShortRest, no resource)
- D) Other solution?

### **Question 3: Ultimate Abilities**
8+ ultimate abilities in Excel (Avatar, Recklessness, Bladestorm, etc.), currently NO resource assigned.

**What should we do?**
- A) Create UltimateCharge resource (max 1, Long Rest)
- B) Use high Rage costs (e.g., -80 Rage)
- C) Use cooldowns only (OncePerCombat)
- D) Other solution?

### **Question 4: Mobility Abilities**
4 abilities assigned to MobilityCharge (max 2), plus 4+ potential mobility abilities in Excel.

**What should we do?**
- A) Increase MobilityCharge max to 4
- B) Some mobility abilities use Rage costs instead
- C) Use cooldowns only (OncePerShortRest)
- D) Other solution?

### **Question 5: Protection L5 "Shield Block (2nd charge)"**
Excel shows Protection gets "Shield Block (2nd charge resource)" at L5.

**Clarification needed**:
- Is this granting a 2nd charge of Shield Block resource (max 1 ‚Üí max 2)?
- Or is this a separate ability/passive that enhances Shield Block?
- How does this interact with TankCooldown resource?

---

## üîß **RECOMMENDED APPROACH** (Agent Suggestion)

Based on Excel analysis and BG3 standards, I recommend:

### **1. Keep Current Resources** ‚úÖ
- **Rage** (100 max) - Universal currency for offensive abilities
- **MobilityCharge** (increase to 3 max) - Charge, Heroic Leap, Intervene, Storm Bolt
- **OverpowerCharge** (2 max, proc) - Overpower
- **ThunderCharge** (3 max, proc) - Thunder Clap

### **2. Merge Defensive Resources** üîÑ
- **DefensiveCooldown** (3 max, Long Rest) - Merges DefensiveCharge + TankCooldown
  - Die by the Sword, Berserker Rage, Last Stand, Shield Wall, Indomitable
  - Assigns remaining defensive abilities (Second Wind, Rallying Cry, Spell Reflection, etc.)

### **3. Create New Resources** ‚ú®
- **ShoutCharge** (2 max, Short Rest) - All shout abilities (Battle Shout, Intimidating Shout, etc.)
- **UltimateCharge** (1 max, Long Rest) - Ultimate abilities (Avatar, Recklessness, Bladestorm, etc.)

### **4. Use Rage Costs for Remaining** üí∞
- Buffs without shouts: -15 to -25 Rage
- Utility abilities: -10 to -20 Rage
- Minor abilities: -5 to -15 Rage

**Total Resources**: 6 Warrior resources (Rage, MobilityCharge, DefensiveCooldown, ShoutCharge, UltimateCharge, OverpowerCharge, ThunderCharge)

## ‚è≠Ô∏è **NEXT STEPS**

1. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Complete FILES 4-10 transformation** (implement all abilities in stat files)
2. ‚è∏Ô∏è **User answers Questions 1-5** (decide resource system structure)
3. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Run Phase 1 audit** (categorize all abilities from stat files)
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Implement resource changes** (ActionResourceDefinitions.lsx + Progressions.lsx)
5. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Update stat files** (assign UseCosts to all abilities)
6. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Run Phase 5 simulations** (validate balance)
7. ‚úÖ **Document final resource system** in SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md Section [10]

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKED** - Waiting for FILES 4-10 transformation + user decisions  
**Priority**: üî¥ **HIGH** - 200+ abilities need resource assignments!
