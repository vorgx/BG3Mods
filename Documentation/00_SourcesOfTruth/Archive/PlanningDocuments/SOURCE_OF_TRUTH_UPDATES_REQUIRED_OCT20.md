## ‚úÖ Issues Found - 2 Corrections Needed

### Issue 1: Fury L1 Baseline Has Stances (INCORRECT)

**Location**: Line 1090

**‚ùå CURRENT (INCORRECT)**:
```markdown
| **Fury** | Whirlwind + Berserker Rage + Battle Stance + Defensive Stance | ‚Äî | ‚Äî (stances in baseline) | **4** (2 abilities + 2 stances) |
```

**‚úÖ SHOULD BE**:
```markdown
| **Fury** | Whirlwind + Berserker Rage | ‚Äî | Battle Stance + Defensive Stance (Stances) | **4** (2 abilities + 2 stances) |
```

**Explanation**: 
- Fury baseline (columns I-J in Excel) only contains Whirlwind + Berserker Rage
- Battle Stance + Defensive Stance come from Class Talents Row 1 (columns K-L)
- ALL Warriors get stances from Class Talents Row 1, not from baseline

### Issue 2: Colossus Keystone Shows "Demolish + Colossal Might" (INCORRECT)

**Location**: Line 927

**‚ùå CURRENT (INCORRECT)**:
```markdown
| **Colossus** | **Arms + Protection** | Demolish + Colossal Might | Dominance of the Colossus | Physical dominance, crowd control |
```

**‚úÖ SHOULD BE**:
```markdown
| **Colossus** | **Arms + Protection** | Demolish | Dominance of the Colossus | Physical dominance, crowd control |
```

**Explanation**:
- L13 Keystone is "Demolish" only (Excel column BG, row 16)
- "Colossal Might" is a separate talent granted at L15 (Excel column BH, row 18)
- L15 grants: Martial Expert + Colossal Might + Earthquake (3 talents)

## ‚úÖ No Issues Found - Already Correct

### Feat Count - Already Correct ‚úÖ

SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md correctly shows:
- Section [3.3] covers L1-L12 only
- Lists Feats at L4, L8, L12 (3 Feats in that section)
- Does NOT claim to cover L13-L20 Feats

**No correction needed** - The document is scoped to L1-L12, so it correctly shows 3 Feats.

**Note**: When Section [5] (L13-L20) is added, it should include:
- L16 Feat
- L19 Feat
- L20 Feat
- Total L13-L20: 3 additional Feats (6 total L1-L20)

### Check Section [3.1] Detailed Ability Breakdown

**Verify**: Only lists Whirlwind + Berserker Rage, NOT stances
