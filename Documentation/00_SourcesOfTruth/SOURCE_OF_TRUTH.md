**Script UUIDs**:
- `1953f77d-a201-45d7-a194-9b84c34b8461` - Primary Script Extender hook
- `0d6510f5-50a3-4ecd-83d8-134c9a640324` - Secondary Script Extender hook

**Parameters**: Both scripts have `HardcoreOnly=0` (mod works in all game modes)

### Version Management Strategy

**Current Version**: v1.0.0.0 (`Version64` = `36028797018963968`)

**Version Format**: BG3 uses `Version64` (int64) encoding semantic versions:
- Major version in high bits
- Minor/patch/build in lower bits
- Example: `36028797018963968` = v1.0.0.0

**Versioning Protocol**:
1. Increment version for each release
2. Update both `Version64` and `PublishVersion` attributes
3. Update `PublishVersion` child node to match
4. Document changes in `CHANGELOG.md`

**Version History**:
- v1.0.0.0 (`36028797018963968`) - Initial release with FILES 1-3 complete

### UUID Consistency Rules

**CRITICAL**: The following MUST all match `78fe4967-4e62-5491-d981-dd781acca4d7`:

1. ✅ `meta.lsx` → `<attribute id="UUID" value="78fe4967-4e62-5491-d981-dd781acca4d7"/>`
2. ✅ `meta.lsx` → `<attribute id="Folder" value="Warrior_Wow_78fe4967-4e62-5491-d981-dd781acca4d7"/>`
3. ✅ Folder name: `Data/Mods/Warrior_Wow_78fe4967-4e62-5491-d981-dd781acca4d7/`
4. ✅ Folder name: `Data/Public/Warrior_Wow_78fe4967-4e62-5491-d981-dd781acca4d7/`
5. ✅ `ClassDescriptions.lsx` → Base class UUID
6. ✅ All documentation references

**Validation**: Run `Test-MetaLsx.ps1` to verify UUID consistency across all files.

### Historical Context

**Design Source**: `Documentation/07_DesignDocuments/Warrior_Class_Blueprint.md`  
**Comparison Analysis**: `Tests/05_Troubleshooting/COMPREHENSIVE_MOD_COMPARISON.md`

**Key Findings from Analysis**:
- WoWWarlock (working mod) has 13 dependencies → We inherited all 13
- WoWWarlock has 2 Script entries → We inherited structure
- DemonHunter (working mod) has 0 dependencies → Proves dependencies are optional but we kept them for compatibility
- Empty Scripts node caused crashes in testing → Populated structure resolved issues

### Cross-References

- **Actual File**: `Data/Mods/Warrior_Wow_78fe4967-4e62-5491-d981-dd781acca4d7/meta.lsx`
- **Template**: `Transformation_Templates/FILE_01_meta.lsx_TEMPLATE.md`
- **Test Script**: `Transformation_Templates/Tests/FILE_01_Test-MetaLsx.ps1`
- **Test Results**: Run `Test-AllFiles.ps1` (FILE 1 should pass with all validations)

## [3] Class Details

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Last Updated**: October 19, 2025

---

### Base Class Definition

#### Overview

The **Warrior** class is a custom implementation of World of Warcraft's iconic melee combatant, adapted to Baldur's Gate 3's D&D 5e-based mechanics. Warriors excel at close-quarters combat, wearing heavy armor and wielding any weapon with devastating proficiency. They harness **Rage** (a custom resource system) to fuel powerful abilities across three distinct specializations.

**Class Identity**: Martial combat masters who generate Rage through dealing and taking damage, then expend it to unleash devastating attacks, defensive maneuvers, or tactical strikes.

#### SpellList UUID Note

**UUID**: `32879c22-4858-48ef-8f8d-22e6d395b396`

**Status**: ⚠️ **Placeholder from Warlock Template**

**Discovery** (FILE_02_TEMPLATE.md lines 28-42):
- Referenced in all ClassDescription nodes in Warlock template
- **NEVER defined** in SpellLists.lsx
- NOT used in Progressions.lsx (different UUIDs there)
- Appears to be "dummy/ghost reference" ignored by BG3 engine

**Decision**: **KEEP unchanged** until FILE 12 (SpellLists.lsx) is transformed
- Proven working pattern (WoWWarlock mod with 13K+ downloads)
- Changing it may break unknown game systems
- Abilities are granted via Progressions.lsx, not this SpellList reference

**Future**: When FILE 12 is complete, this will be updated to the real Warrior SpellList UUID that organizes our 135+ abilities.

---

#### ProgressionTableUUID Note

**UUID**: `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7a8b-9c0d-1e2f3a4b5c6d`

**Status**: ⚠️ **Placeholder**

**Purpose**: Links this ClassDescription to the base Warrior progression table in Progressions.lsx (FILE 4).

**Source**: FILE_02_TEMPLATE.md (line 63)

**Current State**: Placeholder UUID from initial transformation.

**Future**: When FILE 4 (Progressions.lsx) is transformed, this will be replaced with the actual ProgressionTableUUID for the base Warrior L1-L20 progression.

### Core Mechanics

**Last Updated**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Source**: Excel `Warrior Progression for all subclasses.xlsx` + EXCEL_WARRIOR_PROGRESSION_ANALYSIS.md

---

#### Overview

This subsection documents the fundamental mechanics that define how Warriors function in BG3, including the Rage resource system, combat mechanics, proficiency progression, and secondary resource systems.

---

#### 1. Rage System

**Resource Name**: Rage  
**UUID**: `8fe271a3-3f3c-4170-8c6a-a6eb9b597894` (Warrior mod)  
**Template Source**: WoWWarlock Soul Shards (`bdb3fa73-401b-4979-f02e-485422dd8d9c`)

##### Rage Mechanics Comparison

| Attribute | Warrior (Rage) | WoWWarlock (Soul Shards) | Source/Status |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| **Resource Type** | Rage | Soul Shards | ActionResourceDefinitions.lsx |
| **MaxLevel** | 1 | 1 | Both use single tier |
| **MaxValue** | 100 | 5 | Warrior scales 0-100, Warlock 0-5 |
| **ReplenishType** | Never | Never | Combat-only resources (no auto-regen) |
| **ShowOnActionResourcePanel** | True | True | Displayed in character UI |
| **Generation** | Dealing/taking damage | Killing blows, specific spells | Different generation mechanics |
| **Decay** | Out of combat | None | Warrior Rage decays, Warlock persists |
| **Unlock Level** | L1 (Passive) | L1 (Class Feature) | Both start at character creation |

##### Rage Generation Flowchart

```
Combat Start
    ↓
[Rage Pool: 0/100]
    ↓
Generate Rage:
- Auto-attacks: +5-10 Rage
- Taking damage: +5-15 Rage  
- Charge: +20 Rage
- Whirlwind: +10 Rage
    ↓
[Rage Pool: Accumulating]
    ↓
Spend Rage:
- Heroic Strike: -30 Rage
- Execute: -20-40 Rage (variable)
- Mortal Strike: -30 Rage
- Bloodthirst: -20 Rage
    ↓
Combat Continues (Generate → Spend cycle)
    ↓
Combat Ends
    ↓
[Rage Decay: -5 per turn out of combat]
    ↓
[Rage Pool: 0/100] (Reset for next combat after ~1.5 minutes)
```

**Key Design Notes**:
- **Warrior Rage** is a **combat-only resource** (decays out of combat at -5 per turn, ~1.5 min to full decay)
- **Warlock Soul Shards** persist between combats (strategic resource management)
- Both resources **do NOT auto-regenerate** during combat (must be earned)
- **Balance Validation**: See `RAGE_COMBAT_SIMULATION.md` for 5-round combat simulation confirming balanced generation/spending

---

#### 2. Combat Mechanics

##### Extra Attack Progression

| Level | Class | Extra Attack Granted | Implementation |
|-------|-------|---------------------|----------------|
| **L5** | Warrior (All Subclasses) | ✅ Attack twice per Attack action | Standard BG3 martial progression |
| **L5** | Warlock (All Subclasses) | ❌ No Extra Attack | Caster class, uses Eldritch Blast scaling |
| **L11** | Fighter | ✅ Third attack (NOT implemented) | BG3 standard stops at 2 attacks |

**Warrior Implementation**: `PassivesAdded="ExtraAttack"` in Progressions.lsx at Level 5

---

##### Action Economy Breakdown

| Action Type | Warrior Examples | WoWWarlock Examples | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Action** | Charge, Execute, Mortal Strike, Whirlwind | Eldritch Blast, Hex, Summon spells | Primary attack/spell |
| **Bonus Action** | Battle Shout, Overpower, Revenge | Hex (move curse), Misty Step | Secondary abilities |
| **Reaction** | Spell Reflection, Revenge (reactive) | Hellish Rebuke, Counterspell | Triggered by enemy actions |
| **Free Action** | Rage generation (passive), Stance switching | Soul Shard generation | Always-available mechanics |

---

##### Base Class Abilities Unlock Levels

**CRITICAL NOTE**: Each subclass receives **the same 12 baseline abilities** but in **DIFFERENT UNLOCK ORDERS** to support unique playstyles!

###### Level 1 - Starting Loadout (SUBCLASS-SPECIFIC!)

**All Warriors Receive**:
- ✅ Rage Resource (100 max)
- ✅ Battle Stance + Defensive Stance (Class Talents Row 1, auto-granted)

**Arms Warrior (L1)**:
- ✅ Whirlwind (Offensive - AoE cleave)
- ✅ Charge (Utility - Gap closer)
- **Total L1 Features**: 4 (Rage + 2 stances + 2 abilities)

**Protection Warrior (L1)** - **TANK-READY FROM START!**:
- ✅ Shield Slam (Offensive - Damage + threat)
- ✅ Taunt (Utility - Threat control)
- ✅ Mastery: Critical Block (Passive - Damage mitigation)
- **Total L1 Features**: 5 (Rage + 2 stances + 3 abilities) ← **Extra feature for tanking!**

**Fury Warrior (L1)** - **ENRAGE IDENTITY FROM START!**:
- ✅ Whirlwind (Offensive - Dual-wield AoE)
- ✅ Berserker Rage (Utility - Enrage mechanic, CC removal)
- **Total L1 Features**: 4 (Rage + 2 stances + 2 abilities)

**Design Insight**: Protection gets an extra feature at L1 (Mastery: Critical Block) to enable immediate tank capability. Fury gets Berserker Rage at L1 (vs. L5 for other specs) to define enrage-focused gameplay from character creation.

###### Key Unlock Timing Differences

| Ability | Arms | Protection | Fury | Design Rationale |
|---------|------|-----------|------|------------------|
| **Shield Slam** | L12 | **L1** ✨ | L12 | Protection needs offensive threat tool from start |
| **Taunt** | L9 | **L1** ✨ | L9 | Protection needs threat control from start |
| **Execute** | **L3** ✨ | **L10** | L7 | Arms specialty finisher early (7 level gap vs. Protection) |
| **Berserker Rage** | L7 | — | **L1** ✨ | Fury enrage identity from start (6 level gap vs. Arms) |
| **Charge** | L1 | L5 | L3 | Arms gets mobility first, Fury 2nd, Protection last |
| **Whirlwind** | L1 | L12 | L1 | DPS specs get AoE early, tanks get it 11 levels later |
| **Pummel** | L3 | L7 | L5 | Arms gets interrupt earliest, tanks 2nd |
| **Victory Rush** | L9 | L9 | **L5** ✨ | Fury gets sustain earliest (4 level gap) - glass cannon needs healing |
| **Hamstring** | **L5** ✨ | L11 | L9 | Arms gets snare earliest (6 level gap vs. Protection) |

**Design Philosophy**:
1. **Protection = Tank-Ready L1**: Shield Slam + Taunt + Mastery enables tanking immediately
2. **Arms = Execute Specialist**: Gets Execute at L3 (vs. L7/L9) to define big finisher playstyle
3. **Fury = Enrage Identity**: Gets Berserker Rage at L1 (vs. L7/L12) to enable enrage gameplay from start
4. **Different Order = Different Feel**: All specs get same 12 abilities, but pacing creates unique gameplay

---

###### Hero Talent Specializations (L13-20 Accessibility)

**Critical Design Note**: At Level 13, Warriors choose ONE of three specializations. Each specialization is accessible by TWO subclasses:

| Specialization | Accessible By | Keystone (L13) | Capstone (L20) | Theme |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| **Mountain Thane** | **Protection + Fury** | Lightning Strikes | Avatar of the Storm | Thunder/Lightning mechanics |
| **Colossus** | **Arms + Protection** | Demolish | Dominance of the Colossus | Physical dominance, crowd control |
| **Slayer** | **Arms + Fury** | Slayer's Dominance | Unrelenting Onslaught | Execute enhancement, DPS focus |

**Structure**: Each specialization grants **11 talents** (ALL auto-granted, 0 player choices):
- **L13**: Keystone (1 talent)
- **L14**: Empty
- **L15**: 3 talents (auto-granted)
- **L16**: Empty
- **L17**: 3 talents (auto-granted)
- **L18**: Empty
- **L19**: 3 talents (auto-granted)
- **L20**: Capstone (1 talent)

**Source**: Excel `Warrior Progression for all subclasses.xlsx` columns 56-64 (confirmed Row 3 header: "Auto Granted")

---

###### WoWWarlock Baseline Ability Comparison

**Warlock Baseline Structure** (for reference):
- **L1**: Eldritch Blast (Offensive cantrip, scales with level)
- **L2**: Eldritch Invocations (choice system, 2 selections)
- **L3**: Pact Boon (Pact of the Blade / Chain / Tome)
- **L5**: Eldritch Blast 2 beams (scales with character level, not Extra Attack)
- **L11**: Mystic Arcanum (6th level spell)

**Key Difference**: Warlock uses **choice-based progression** (pick Eldritch Invocations, pick Pact Boon), while Warrior uses **auto-grant progression** (all baseline abilities granted automatically in subclass-specific order).

---

##### Weapon & Armor System

| Category | Arms Warrior | Fury Warrior | Protection Warrior | WoWWarlock | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Primary Armor** | Heavy | Medium (mobility focus) | Heavy | Light | Fury trades armor for mobility |
| **Secondary Armor** | — | Heavy (if desired) | — | — | Fury can use Heavy but loses mobility bonuses |
| **Shields** | ✅ Proficient | ✅ Proficient | ✅ Proficient (required) | ❌ Not proficient | Protection requires shield for mechanics |
| **Weapon Type** | Two-handed (2H) | Dual-wield (1H+1H or 2H+2H via Titan's Grip) | One-handed + Shield (1H+Shield) | Simple/Light weapons | Each spec has preferred setup |
| **Weapon Proficiency** | Simple + Martial | Simple + Martial | Simple + Martial | Simple only | Warriors master all weapons |

**Design Note**: Fury's unique mechanic is **Titan's Grip** (dual-wield two 2H weapons), distinguishing it from Arms (single 2H) and Protection (1H+Shield).

#### 3. Proficiency Progression

##### Proficiency Boosts Table

| Proficiency | Boost String | Level Granted | Warrior | WoWWarlock | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **STR Save** | `SavingThrowProficiency(Strength)` | L1 | ✅ | ❌ (CHA save) | Core Warrior identity |
| **CON Save** | `SavingThrowProficiency(Constitution)` | L1 | ✅ | ❌ (WIS save) | Tank durability |
| **Light Armor** | `Proficiency(LightArmor)` | L1 | ✅ | ✅ | Both classes start with Light |
| **Medium Armor** | `Proficiency(MediumArmor)` | L1 | ✅ | ❌ | Warrior martial proficiency |
| **Heavy Armor** | `Proficiency(HeavyArmor)` | L1 | ✅ (Arms/Prot)<br>Optional (Fury) | ❌ | Fury prefers Medium for mobility |
| **Shields** | `Proficiency(Shields)` | L1 | ✅ | ❌ | Protection requires for mechanics |
| **Simple Weapons** | `Proficiency(SimpleWeapons)` | L1 | ✅ | ✅ | Both classes have access |
| **Martial Weapons** | `Proficiency(MartialWeapons)` | L1 | ✅ | ❌ | Warrior exclusive |
| **Extra Attack** | `ActionResource(ActionPoint,1,0)` + `PassivesAdded="ExtraAttack"` | L5 | ✅ | ❌ | Martial class feature |

**Total Proficiencies**: Warrior has **10 proficiency grants** at L1 vs. Warlock's **3** (Light Armor, Simple Weapons, saves)

---

##### Skill Choices by Subclass (Flavor-Driven)

**Selection**: Pick 2 skills at character creation

| Subclass | Skill Options | Flavor Justification |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Arms** | Athletics, Intimidation, Perception, Survival | Battlefield tactician, commanding presence, tactical awareness, endurance |
| **Fury** | Athletics, Acrobatics, Intimidation, Survival | Raging berserker, agile dual-wielder, ferocious presence, relentless |
| **Protection** | Athletics, Intimidation, Perception, Survival, Animal Handling (5 options) | Tank protector, imposing guardian, alert defender, enduring shield, ally protection |

**WoWWarlock Skills** (for comparison): Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, Religion (7 options, knowledge-focused)

**Design Note**: Protection gets **5 skill options** (vs. 4 for Arms/Fury) because tanks need diverse utility. Arms/Fury focus on combat skills, Protection adds Animal Handling for mount/companion tanking.

---

#### 4. Secondary Resource Systems

##### Resource System Comparison

| Resource Name | Max | Replenish | Used By | Unlock Method | Level | Warrior | WoWWarlock Equivalent |
|---------------|-----|-----------|---------|---------------|-------|---------|----------------------|
| **Rage** | 100 | Never (combat-only) | All abilities (costs or generation) | Auto-grant passive | L1 | ✅ Core resource | Soul Shards (5 max) |
| **MobilityCharge** | 2 | Short Rest | Charge, Heroic Leap, Intervene, Storm Bolt | Auto-grant passive | L1 | ✅ Shared cooldown pool | — |
| **DefensiveCharge** | 1 | Long Rest | Die by the Sword, Berserker Rage | Talent choice | L3+ | ✅ Shared defensive pool | — |
| **TankCooldown** | 1 | Long Rest | Last Stand, Shield Wall, Indomitable | Talent choice | L3+ | ✅ Protection cooldowns | — |
| **OverpowerCharge** | 2 | Never (proc-based) | Overpower (Arms) | Dodge/Parry procs | L3+ | ✅ Arms specialty | — |
| **ThunderCharge** | 3 | Never (proc-based) | Thunder Clap (empowered) | Shield Slam 35% proc | L4+ | ✅ Protection synergy | — |
| **Soul Shards** | 5 | Never (kill/spell generation) | Eldritch spells, summons | Auto-grant passive | L1 | ❌ | ✅ Warlock core |
| **Soul Shard Fragment** | 3 | Never (combat generation) | Convert to Soul Shards (3 frags = 1 shard) | Auto-grant passive | L1 | ❌ | ✅ Warlock secondary |

**Source**: CHARGE_RESOURCES_DEEP_DIVE.md (corrected max values)

**Design Philosophy**:
- **Rage**: Universal currency for all Warrior abilities (like Soul Shards for Warlock)
- **Charge Systems**: Limit mobility/defensive spam via shared cooldown pools
- **Proc Resources**: Reward smart play (Overpower from dodge/parry, Thunder Clap from Shield Slam)

**⚠️ RESOURCE SYSTEM REVIEW PENDING**: After FILES 4-10 transformation complete, audit all 200+ abilities from Excel to ensure correct resource assignments. See `EXCEL_ABILITY_COUNT_SUMMARY.md` for complete ability inventory requiring resource costs.

### Overview

This subsection documents what abilities Warriors receive at each level from 1-12, showing how the three subclasses (Arms, Fury, Protection) receive **12 baseline abilities** in **different orders** to create distinct playstyles. Each level shows:

- **BG3 Milestones**: Standard game features (Extra Attack, Feats, etc.)
- **Baseline Abilities Granted**: Auto-granted abilities per subclass
- **Total Features**: Count of new abilities/passives/resources

**Critical Design Note**: 
- Levels 4, 8, and 12 are **Feat/ASI levels** (baseline abilities still granted at L12)
- Levels 2, 6, and 10 are **talent choice levels** (no baseline abilities, but talent choices available)
- **All subclasses complete 12 baseline abilities by L12** (ready for hero talents at L13+)

---

### Level 1 - Character Creation (Starting Loadout)

**BG3 Milestones**: Starting level, subclass selection

**Universal Grants** (All Warriors):
- ✅ **Rage Resource** (0-100 max, combat-only, decays -5 per turn out of combat)
- ✅ **Proficiencies**: 
  - Saves: STR, CON
  - Armor: Light, Medium, Heavy
  - Shields: Yes
  - Weapons: Simple, Martial
- ✅ **Passives**: `WAR_UnlockRage`, `WAR_RageGeneration`

**Subclass-Specific Grants**:

| Subclass | Baseline Abilities | Baseline Passives | Class Talents (Row 1) | Total Features |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Arms** | Whirlwind + Charge | — | Battle Stance + Defensive Stance (Stances) | **4** (2 abilities + 2 stances) |
| **Protection** | Shield Slam + Taunt | Mastery: Critical Block | Battle Stance + Defensive Stance (Stances) | **5** (2 abilities + 1 passive + 2 stances) |
| **Fury** | Whirlwind + Berserker Rage | — | Battle Stance + Defensive Stance (Stances) | **4** (2 abilities + 2 stances) |

**Detailed Ability Breakdown**:

**Arms Warrior (L1)**:
- 🗡️ **Whirlwind** (Offensive) - AoE cleave attack
- 🛡️ **Charge** (Utility) - Gap closer, generates Rage
- 💪 **Battle Stance** (Stance - Class Talent Row 1)
- 💪 **Defensive Stance** (Stance - Class Talent Row 1)

**Protection Warrior (L1)** - **TANK-READY FROM START!**:
- 🗡️ **Shield Slam** (Offensive) - Damage + threat generation
- 🛡️ **Taunt** (Utility) - Threat control
- 💪 **Mastery: Critical Block** (Passive) - Damage mitigation on critical blocks
- 💪 **Battle Stance** (Stance - Class Talent Row 1)
- 💪 **Defensive Stance** (Stance - Class Talent Row 1)

**Fury Warrior (L1)** - **ENRAGE IDENTITY FROM START!**:
- 🗡️ **Whirlwind** (Offensive) - Dual-wield AoE cleave
- 🛡️ **Berserker Rage** (Utility) - Enrage mechanic, CC removal, Rage generation
- 💪 **Battle Stance** (Stance - Baseline Ability)
- 💪 **Defensive Stance** (Stance - Baseline Ability)

**Design Philosophy**:
- **Arms**: Mobility + AoE damage from start (Charge + Whirlwind) + stances from Class Talents Row 1
- **Protection**: Full tank kit from level 1 (threat + mitigation + stances from Class Talents Row 1)
- **Fury**: Enrage mechanic defines identity immediately (Berserker Rage at L1 vs. L7 for others) + stances in baseline abilities

**Critical Difference**: 
- **Arms/Protection**: Get stances from **Class Talents Row 1** (Battle Stance + Defensive Stance, auto-granted)
- **Fury**: Gets stances as **Baseline Abilities** (Battle Stance + Defensive Stance, part of subclass identity)

**⚠️ Important Note**: Class Talents Row 1 is **AUTO-GRANTED** at character creation (not a player choice). The stances (Battle Stance + Defensive Stance) are given automatically for **Arms/Protection/Fury** - Arms/Protection receive them from Class Talents Row 1, while Fury receives them as Baseline Abilities. **First player choice is Class Talents Row 2 at Level 2.**

**Total Starting Features** (including proficiencies + Rage + abilities):
- Arms: **13** (9 proficiencies + Rage + 2 abilities + 2 stances)
- Protection: **14** (9 proficiencies + Rage + 2 abilities + 1 passive + 2 stances)

---

### Level 2 - Talent Choice Level

**BG3 Milestones**: None

**Baseline Abilities Granted**: None

**Talent Choices Available**: Class Talent Row 2 (4 options)

**Design Note**: This is the **FIRST PLAYER CHOICE** - no auto-granted abilities, but players pick 1 talent from Row 2 (Fast Footwork | War Machine | Leeching Strikes | Intervene). Class Talents Row 1 was already auto-granted at L1 (stances for Arms/Protection, or part of Fury's baseline abilities).

---

### Level 3 - Subclass Specialization Begins

- 🛡️ **Charge** (Utility) - Gap closer (same as Arms L1)

**Design Philosophy**:
- **Arms**: Gets **Execute at L3** (vs. L7/L9 for other specs) to define "execute specialist" identity
- **Protection**: Gets full defensive toolkit (Shield Block + Riposte) to enable tank gameplay
- **Fury**: Gets mobility (Charge) 2 levels later than Arms, prioritizes damage (Slam) first

| **Battle Shout** | **L5** ✨ | L11 | L7 | Arms gets group buff earliest (6 level gap vs. Protection) |
| **Victory Rush** | L9 | L9 | **L5** ✨ | Fury gets sustain earliest (4 level gap) - glass cannon needs healing |
| **Hamstring** | **L5** ✨ | L11 | L9 | Arms gets snare earliest (6 level gap vs. Protection) |
| **Heroic Throw** | L11 | **L5** ✨ | L11 | Protection gets ranged pull earliest (6 level gap vs. DPS specs) |
| **Shield Block** | — | **L3** ✨ | — | Protection exclusive (tank mechanic) |
| **Shield Block 2nd charge** | — | **L5** ✨ | — | Protection exclusive (resource upgrade) |

**Design Philosophy**:
1. **Protection = Tank-Ready L1**: Shield Slam + Taunt + Mastery enables tanking immediately
2. **Arms = Execute Specialist**: Gets Execute at L3 (7 levels before Protection, 4 before Fury)
3. **Fury = Enrage Identity**: Gets Berserker Rage at L1 (6 levels before Arms) - Protection never gets it
4. **Signature Ability Swap at L12**: DPS specs get Shield Slam (Protection's L1 signature) at L12, Protection gets Whirlwind (DPS L1 signature) at L12 - perfect 11-level symmetry
5. **Different Order = Different Feel**: Specs get similar but not identical toolkits - Protection trades Berserker Rage for extra tank utilities

#### Talent Choices by Level (L1-L10)

| Level | Class Talents | SubclassSpec Talents | Feat/ASI | Total Choices |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|----------|---------------|
| **L1** | Auto-grant (Row 1) | Auto-grant | — | 0 (all auto-granted) |
| **L2** | Row 2 (4 options) | — | — | **1** |
| **L3** | Row 3 | Row 1 | — | **2** |
| **L4** | Row 4 | Row 2 | ✅ | **3** |
| **L5** | Row 5 | Row 3 | — | **2** |
| **L6** | Row 6 | Row 4 | — | **2** |
| **L7** | Row 7 (9 options ⭐) | Row 5 | — | **2** |
| **L8** | Row 8 | Row 6 | ✅ | **3** |
| **L9** | Row 9 (3 options) | Row 7 | — | **2** |
| **L10** | Row 10 (FINAL) | Row 8 | — | **2** |
| **L11** | — (Class Talents ended) | Row 9 | — | **1** |
| **L12** | — (Class Talents ended) | Row 10 (FINAL) | ✅ | **2** (Feat + SubclassSpec) |
| **TOTAL** | **10 rows** | **10 rows** | **3** | **24 choices** |

**⚠️ Important Note**: **Class Talents** and **SubclassSpec Talents** are TWO SEPARATE SYSTEMS with their own Row numbering:

- **Class Talents (Rows 1-10)**: Shared by ALL Warriors (Arms, Fury, Protection)
  - Row 1: Auto-granted stances (Battle + Defensive) for Arms/Protection at L1 *(Fury gets stances as Baseline Abilities instead)*
  - Rows 2-10: Player choices at L2-L10
  
- **SubclassSpec Talents (Rows 1-10)**: Unique per subclass (Arms has different choices than Fury/Protection)
  - Row 1 = First SubclassSpec choice at L3 *(NOT related to Class Talents Row 1)*
  - Rows 2-8 = SubclassSpec choices at L4-L10
  - Rows 9-10 = SubclassSpec choices at L11-L12 *(NOW INCLUDED in this breakdown)*

**Why This Matters**: When you see "Row 1" at L3, this is **SubclassSpec Talent Row 1** (your first subclass-specific choice), NOT Class Talents Row 1 (which was already auto-granted at L1 for Arms/Protection, or given as Baseline Abilities for Fury).

**Key Insight**: Players make **24 total choices** in levels 1-12 (9 Class Talent choices + 10 SubclassSpec Talent choices + 3 Feats at L4/L8/L12 + 2 ASIs). This is EXCLUDING hero talent choices at L13-20.

## [4] Subclasses

**Status**: 🚧 In Progress - [4.1] Arms Complete  
**Last Updated**: October 20, 2025

---

### [4.1] Arms Warrior

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Last Updated**: October 20, 2025

---

#### 4.1.1 Subclass Identity

**Flavor**: Arms Warriors are disciplined weapon masters who wield massive two-handed weapons with lethal precision. They excel at executing wounded foes, applying crippling wounds, and breaking enemy armor with devastating strikes. Arms Warriors favor calculated, high-impact attacks over frenetic rage.

**Core Concept**: Two-handed weapon specialist focused on precise, powerful strikes with execution mechanics.

**Equipment**:
- **Primary Weapons**: Two-handed swords, axes, maces, polearms
- **Armor**: Heavy armor (plate mail, full plate)
- **Special**: Can use shields situationally (unlike Fury)

**Ability Scores** (from Section [1]):
- **Primary**: Strength (damage, to-hit)
- **Secondary**: Constitution (durability)
- **Hit Dice**: d10 (6 HP per level)

**WoW Fantasy**: The Arms Warrior is a battle-hardened veteran who strikes with surgical precision. Every swing of their massive blade is intended to cripple, bleed, or execute. They are the embodiment of controlled fury—patient, tactical, and utterly lethal.

---

#### 4.1.2 Unique Mechanics

**Mastery: Deep Wounds** (Auto-granted at L3)
- **Effect**: Critical hits with melee attacks apply a bleeding wound that deals 1d4 slashing damage per turn for 6 turns
- **Stacking**: Multiple crits refresh duration
- **Synergy**: Works with all melee attacks (baseline abilities, spec abilities, even basic attacks)

**Mortal Strike Mechanic**
- **Core Ability**: Arms' signature strike (unlocked at L3 via Row 1 auto-grant)
- **Effect**: Deals 2d12 + Strength damage and applies **Mortal Wounds** debuff
- **Mortal Wounds**: Reduces target's healing received by 50% for 6 turns
- **Anti-Heal Specialty**: Makes Arms excellent against regenerating enemies

**Execute Specialist**
- **Early Access**: Arms gets Execute at **L3** (Fury L7, Protection L10)
- **Enhancement Options**: Multiple SubclassSpec Talents improve Execute (Improved Execute, Sudden Death, Executioner's Precision)
- **Design Philosophy**: Arms is THE execution specialist—rewards finishing wounded enemies

**Two-Handed Weapon Focus**
- **Seasoned Soldier** (Auto-granted L3): Passive bonuses to two-handed weapon damage
- **Talent Synergies**: Many Arms talents boost two-handed weapon attacks (Martial Prowess, Strength of Arms)
- **No Dual-Wield**: Arms cannot dual-wield (unlike Fury)

---

#### 4.1.3 Baseline Ability Progression (L1-L12)

**Full Details**: See Section [3.3] Level-by-Level Base Class Features

**Quick Reference Table**:

| Level | Abilities Granted | Total Features at Level |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **L1** | Whirlwind + Charge | 2 abilities + 2 stances (Battle/Defensive from Class Talents Row 1) = **4 features** |
| **L3** | Execute + Pummel | +2 abilities = **6 features** |
| **L5** | Hamstring + Battle Shout | +2 abilities = **8 features** |
| **L7** | Slam + Berserker Rage | +2 abilities = **10 features** |
| **L9** | Victory Rush + Taunt | +2 abilities = **12 features** |
| **L11** | Heroic Throw | +1 ability = **13 features** |
| **L12** | Shield Slam | +1 ability = **14 features** |

**Total Baseline Abilities (L1-L12)**: **15 features** (8 offensive + 7 utility)

**Key Ability Timing**:
- **Execute**: L3 ✨ (earliest of all specs - Arms specialty!)
- **Berserker Rage**: L7 (Fury had at L1)
- **Taunt**: L9 (Protection had at L1)
- **Shield Slam**: L12 (Protection had at L1 - 11 level gap!)

**Design Philosophy**: Arms gets offensive abilities early (Execute L3, Whirlwind L1) for aggressive DPS focus, but utility abilities come later (Taunt L9, Heroic Throw L11) as Arms is less concerned with threat management than Protection.

---

##### Design Note: Hero Talents vs. SubclassSpec Talents

**Key Differences**:
- **L1-L12 (SubclassSpec Talents)**: Player makes **10 choices** (Rows 3-10, one per level)
- **L13-L20 (Hero Talents)**: Player makes **1 choice** (Colossus OR Slayer at L13), then receives **8 auto-granted talents** as they level
- **Auto-Grant Philosophy**: Hero talents are pre-designed power spikes, not customizable—this reduces choice complexity at endgame

**Specialization Choice Impact**:
- **Colossus**: More single-target focused, tank-friendly synergies, titan fantasy
- **Slayer**: More cleave/execute focused, Fury-like aggression, assassin fantasy

**Cannot Change**: Once you choose at L13, you're committed to that hero talent tree for the character's lifetime

---

##### Recommendation Guide

**Choose Colossus if you built**:
- Execute Master (Demolish provides another burst option)
- Colossus Smash Build (natural armor-break synergy)
- Tank Hybrid (benefits from Protection-themed survivability talents)

**Choose Slayer if you built**:
- Execute Master (double down on Execute mechanics)
- Bleed Specialist (Arterial Blows rewards bleeds)
- AoE Specialist (Culling Strike provides multi-target finisher)
- Overpower Specialist (aggressive playstyle fits Slayer theme)

**Both Work With**: Most Arms builds can use either hero talent—choice often comes down to fantasy preference (titan vs. assassin)

### [4.2] Fury Warrior

**Status**: ✅ Complete (v1.0 - October 20, 2025)  
**Last Updated**: October 20, 2025  
**Template Based On**: Section [4.1] Arms Warrior (gold standard)

---

## 4.2.1 Identity and Flavor

### WoW Fantasy: Relentless Berserker

**Core Identity**: A raging berserker who **dual-wields weapons** with reckless abandon, thriving in extended combat through continuous Enrage states and building rage through a flurry of strikes.

**Key Themes**:
- **Dual-Wielding Specialist**: Can equip weapons in both hands (unlike Arms' two-handed focus or Protection's sword-and-board)
- **Enrage-Driven Combat**: Berserker Rage mechanic available from **L1** (earliest of all specs), constantly triggers Enrage for damage bonuses
- **Glass Cannon**: Trades survivability for raw DPS—medium armor only, no heavy armor
- **Sustained Fury**: Excels in prolonged fights where Rage generation and Enrage uptime shine

**BG3 Adaptation**:
- Dual-wield combat (one-handed weapons in each hand)
- Berserker Rage grants temporary bonuses (damage, CC immunity, Rage generation)
- Bloodthirst provides self-healing to offset fragility
- Raging Blow, Rampage, and Onslaught provide high-frequency attacks

---

### Equipment Proficiencies

**Armor**:
- Light Armor ✅
- Medium Armor ✅
- Heavy Armor ❌ (Fury sacrifices protection for mobility and dual-wield speed)

**Weapons**:
- Simple Weapons ✅
- Martial Weapons ✅
- **Dual-Wield Focus**: One-handed weapons in each hand (swords, axes, maces)

**Shields**: ❌ (cannot use shields—both hands needed for dual-wield)

---

### Ability Scores

**Hit Dice**: d8 (**5 HP per level**)  
**Rationale**: Glass cannon design—lowest durability of all 3 specs (Arms 6 HP/level, Protection 7 HP/level)

**Primary Ability**: **Strength** (melee weapon attacks, damage scaling)  
**Secondary Ability**: **Constitution** (survivability, compensates for medium armor restriction)

**Recommended Starting Array** (Point Buy):
- **STR**: 16-17 (Primary - all attacks scale with STR)
- **CON**: 14-16 (Secondary - need HP to survive as glass cannon)
- **DEX**: 10-12 (Medium armor benefits, initiative)
- **INT/WIS/CHA**: 8-10 (dump stats)

---

## 4.2.2 Unique Mechanics

### Enrage Mechanic (Core Identity)

**Berserker Rage** (Available from **L1**):
- **Unique to Fury**: Arms/Protection get Berserker Rage at L7, Fury gets it immediately at character creation
- **Effect**: Enters Enrage state (bonus damage, CC immunity, generates Rage per turn)
- **Duration**: 3-6 turns (talent-dependent)
- **Philosophy**: Fury identity is built around maintaining Enrage uptime

**Enrage Benefits**:
- +10-20% damage (talent scaling)
- Immunity to crowd control (Fear, Charm, etc.)
- Rage generation per turn (sustains resource economy)
- Synergy with talents (Powerful Enrage, Frenzied Enrage, Recklessness)

---

### Bloodthirst (Self-Sustain Specialist)

**Core Ability**: Fury's signature strike (unlocked at L3 via Row 1 auto-grant)
- **Effect**: Deals 2d8 + Strength damage and **heals self for 2d8 HP**
- **Rage Cost**: 20 Rage
- **Cooldown**: Once per turn
- **Design Philosophy**: Offsets glass cannon fragility with built-in self-healing

---

### Dual-Wield Mastery

**Titan's Grip** (Auto-granted L3):
- Passive bonuses to dual-wield weapon damage
- Enables one-handed weapon in each hand
- Synergy with many Fury talents (Hack and Slash, Single-Minded Fury, Slaughtering Strikes)

---

### Rampage & Onslaught (Execute Specialists)

**Rampage** (Tier 2 Ability - Row 5, L7):
- **Effect**: Multiple rapid strikes, generates Rage, triggers Enrage
- **Philosophy**: Fury's "builder" for extended combat

**Onslaught** (Tier 3 Ability - Row 9, L11):
- **Effect**: Channeled barrage of attacks on single target, massive damage
- **Requirement**: Target must be below 35% HP (or 20% base)
- **Philosophy**: Fury's Execute analog (like Arms' Execute, but sustained channel vs. single strike)

---

## 4.2.3 Baseline Ability Progression (L1-L12)

**Full Details**: See Section [3.3] Level-by-Level Base Class Features

**Quick Reference Table**:

| Level | Abilities Granted | Total Features at Level |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **L1** | Whirlwind + Berserker Rage | 2 abilities + 2 stances (Battle/Defensive - baseline for Fury) = **4 features** |
| **L3** | Charge + Execute | +2 abilities = **6 features** |
| **L5** | Pummel + Slam | +2 abilities = **8 features** |
| **L7** | Hamstring + Battle Shout | +2 abilities = **10 features** |
| **L9** | Taunt + Hamstring | +2 abilities = **12 features** |
| **L11** | Heroic Throw | +1 ability = **13 features** |
| **L12** | Shield Slam | +1 ability = **14 features** |

**Total Baseline Abilities (L1-L12)**: **15 features** (8 offensive + 7 utility)

**Key Ability Timing**:
- **Berserker Rage**: **L1** ✨ (earliest of all specs - Fury specialty! Arms/Protection get at L7)
- **Execute**: L3 (same as Arms, earlier than Protection L10)
- **Whirlwind**: L1 (same as Arms, earlier than Protection L12)
- **Shield Slam**: L12 (Protection had at L1 - 11 level gap!)

**Design Philosophy**: Fury gets Berserker Rage immediately (L1) for Enrage identity, Execute early (L3) for burst damage, and acquires utility later (Taunt L9, Heroic Throw L11). Focus is pure offense with self-sustain through Bloodthirst and Enrage healing talents.

---

## 4.2.4 SubclassSpec Talents (Pool 2 - Fury Only)

**Overview**: Fury Warriors make **10 SubclassSpec Talent choices** from L3-L12 (one per level). These talents define Fury's playstyle and build customization.

## 4.2.9 Hero Talent Transition (L13+)

**At Level 13**, Fury Warriors choose between **2 hero talent specializations**:

---

### Mountain Thane (Fury + Protection)

**Theme**: Storm-empowered warrior, Thunder damage, tanky berserker

**Signature Abilities**:
- **Thunder Clap Enhancement** - Thunder Clap becomes primary damage tool
- **Lightning Strikes** - Rage spenders trigger chain lightning
- **Thorim's Might** - Enrage grants Thunder damage on all attacks
- **Avatar of the Storm** - Transform into lightning-empowered avatar

**Best For**: Fury Warriors who want tankiness without sacrificing damage, AoE focus, Thor fantasy

**Synergy with Fury Builds**:
- **Rampage Enrage**: Permanent Thunder damage through high Enrage uptime
- **AoE Cleave**: Lightning Strikes chains to multiple enemies during Whirlwind/Bladestorm
- **Bloodthirst Specialist**: Thorim's Might provides consistent Thunder damage on Bloodthirst spam

**Playstyle**: Berserker with storm powers—less glass cannon, more durable through Protection-themed talents

**Full Details**: See Section [5] Specializations/Hero Classes

---

### Slayer (Arms + Fury)

**Theme**: Execution specialist, ruthless finisher, relentless pursuit of wounded enemies

**Signature Abilities**:
- **Brutal Finish** - Enhanced Execute mechanics with reduced cooldown
- **Culling Strike** - Multi-target execute (Execute can hit multiple low-HP enemies)
- **Slayer's Strike** - Guaranteed crit on Execute
- **Arterial Blows** - Bleeding enemies take massive bonus damage

**Best For**: Fury Warriors who focus on Execute builds, burst damage, assassination fantasy

**Synergy with Fury Builds**:
- **Execute Specialist**: Natural fit—Onslaught + Culling Strike = multi-target execution
- **Recklessness Burst**: Slayer's Strike guarantees crits (synergy with Recklessness auto-crit)
- **Bloodthirst Specialist**: Arterial Blows rewards bleeds (Fury has fewer bleed talents, but Class Talents provide options)

**Playstyle**: Hunt wounded enemies relentlessly—Execute/Onslaught become your primary tools

**Full Details**: See Section [5] Specializations/Hero Classes

---

### Design Note: Hero Talents vs. SubclassSpec Talents

**Key Differences**:
- **L1-L12 (SubclassSpec Talents)**: Player makes **8 choices** (Rows 3-10, one per level, but Rows 1-2 auto-granted)
- **L13-L20 (Hero Talents)**: Player makes **1 choice** (Mountain Thane OR Slayer at L13), then receives **8 auto-granted talents** as they level
- **Auto-Grant Philosophy**: Hero talents are pre-designed power spikes, not customizable—this reduces choice complexity at endgame

**Specialization Choice Impact**:
- **Mountain Thane**: More AoE focused, tankier, storm/Thunder theme
- **Slayer**: More single-target burst, Execute specialist, assassin fantasy

**Cannot Change**: Once you choose at L13, you're committed to that hero talent tree for the character's lifetime

---

### Recommendation Guide

**Choose Mountain Thane if you built**:
- Rampage Enrage (Thorim's Might provides Thunder damage on every attack)
- AoE Cleave (Lightning Strikes chains during Whirlwind/Bladestorm)
- Bloodthirst Specialist (tankier build benefits from Protection-themed survivability)
- Need more durability (Mountain Thane reduces glass cannon fragility)

**Choose Slayer if you built**:
- Execute Specialist (Onslaught + Culling Strike = multi-target execution)
- Recklessness Burst (Slayer's Strike guarantees crits, synergy with Recklessness)
- Dual-Wield Master (Arterial Blows rewards fast attack speed for bleed application)
- Want pure DPS (Slayer is highest single-target burst)

**Both Work With**: Most Fury builds can use either hero talent—choice often comes down to fantasy preference (storm berserker vs. relentless executioner)

**Core Identity**: An **unbreakable shield-bearer** who thrives on absorbing punishment, turning enemy aggression into powerful counterattacks and protecting allies through crowd control and threat generation.

**Key Themes**:
- **Shield & Heavy Armor Specialist**: **Must** equip a shield in off-hand (cannot dual-wield or use two-handed weapons)
- **Block Mechanic**: Active mitigation through **Shield Block** charges (unique to Protection)
- **Highest Durability**: d12 hit dice (7 HP per level) - tankiest of all 3 specs
- **Threat & Control**: Built-in Taunt at L1, multiple CC abilities, threat generation tools

**BG3 Adaptation**:
- Shield required in off-hand (sword-and-board style)
- Shield Block charges (starts with 1, upgrades to 2 at L5)
- Riposte mechanic (counter-attacks on successful blocks)
- Crowd control specialists (Demoralizing Shout, Shield Charge, Thunder Clap)

---

### Equipment Proficiencies

**Armor**:
- Light Armor ✅
- Medium Armor ✅
- Heavy Armor ✅ (**Protection specialty** - only spec with heavy armor access)

**Weapons**:
- Simple Weapons ✅
- Martial Weapons ✅
- **One-Handed Focus**: Must use one-handed weapon + shield

**Shields**: ✅ **REQUIRED** (Protection identity - cannot function without shield)

---

### Ability Scores

**Hit Dice**: d12 (**7 HP per level**)  
**Rationale**: Tank design—highest durability of all 3 specs (Arms 6 HP/level, Fury 5 HP/level)

**Primary Ability**: **Constitution** (survivability, tank durability)  
**Secondary Ability**: **Strength** (melee weapon attacks, some abilities scale with STR)

**Recommended Starting Array** (Point Buy):
- **CON**: 16-17 (Primary - need HP to tank hits)
- **STR**: 14-16 (Secondary - damage scaling, attack accuracy)
- **DEX**: 10-12 (Medium armor benefits, AC)
- **INT/WIS/CHA**: 8-10 (dump stats)

**Design Note**: Protection is the **only Warrior spec with CON as primary ability score** (Arms/Fury use STR primary). This reflects tank identity—survive first, deal damage second.

---

## 4.3.2 Unique Mechanics

### Block Mechanic (Core Identity)

**Shield Block** (Available from **L3**, upgrades at **L5**):
- **L3**: 1 charge (single use per short rest)
- **L5**: 2 charges (RESOURCE UPGRADE - now 2 uses per short rest)
- **Effect**: Active mitigation—reduce incoming damage by 50-70% for 1 turn (talent-dependent)
- **Philosophy**: Protection's core defensive tool, separates tanks from DPS specs

**Shield Block Enhancements** (via talents):
- **Impenetrable Wall** (L10): Shield Block reduces damage by 70% (up from 50%)
- **Shield Specialization** (L10): Shield Block grants temporary HP
- **Heavy Repercussions** (L8): Shield Block increases next Shield Slam damage

---

### Riposte System (Counter-Attack Specialist)

**Riposte** (Auto-granted at **L3**):
- **Trigger**: When you successfully block an attack
- **Effect**: Immediately counter-attack the attacker (weapon damage)
- **Philosophy**: Rewarding active mitigation with damage output

**Synergy with Talents**:
- **Best Served Cold** (L6): Riposte applies slow debuff
- **Punish** (L8): Riposte generates bonus Rage
- **Heavy Handed** (L11): Riposte deals bonus damage

---

### Shield Slam Enhancement (Tank DPS Tool)

**Shield Slam** (Auto-granted at **L1** - **PROTECTION EXCLUSIVE!**):
- **Effect**: 2d8 + Strength damage, applies armor reduction debuff
- **Rage Cost**: 15 Rage
- **Cooldown**: Once per turn
- **Design Philosophy**: Protection's primary Rage spender, earlier than Arms/Fury (they get it at L12)

**Shield Slam Enhancements** (via talents):
- **Heavy Repercussions** (L8): Shield Slam deals +50% damage after Shield Block
- **Devastator** (L5): Shield Slam resets cooldown on critical hit
- **Punish** (L8): Shield Slam generates bonus Rage on targets with debuffs

---

### Threat Generation & Crowd Control

**Taunt** (Auto-granted at **L1** - earliest of all specs):
- **Effect**: Force enemy to attack you for 2 turns
- **Rage Cost**: 10 Rage
- **Cooldown**: Once per combat

**Shield Block + Riposte** (Auto-granted at **L3**):
- **Shield Block**: Active mitigation (1 charge → 2 charges at L5)
- **Riposte**: Counter-attack on block (passive)

**Crowd Control Options** (via SubclassSpec Talents):
- **Demoralizing Shout** (L4): AoE debuff (enemies deal less damage)
- **Disrupting Shout** (L6): Interrupt all enemies in radius
- **Shield Charge** (L12): Gap closer with stun effect

---

## 4.3.3 Baseline Ability Progression (L1-L12)

**Full Details**: See Section [3.3] Level-by-Level Base Class Features

**Quick Reference Table**:

| Level | Abilities Granted | Total Features at Level |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **L1** | Shield Slam + Taunt | **2 abilities** ✨ (Protection gets offensive + utility from start) |
| **L3** | Devastate + Shield Block + Riposte | **5 features** (2 abilities + 1 resource + 1 passive) |
| **L5** | Heroic Throw + Charge + Shield Block 2nd charge | **9 features** (2 abilities + 1 resource upgrade) |
| **L7** | Slam + Pummel + Vanguard | **12 features** (2 abilities + 1 passive) |
| **L9** | Execute + Victory Rush | **14 features** (2 abilities) |
| **L10** | — | **14 features** (no new abilities) |
| **L11** | Hamstring + Battle Shout | **16 features** (2 abilities) |
| **L12** | Whirlwind | **17 features** (1 ability) |

**Total Baseline Abilities (L1-L12)**: **20 features** (12 offensive + 8 utility)  
**Note**: Protection has **5 more baseline abilities** than Arms/Fury (15 each)

**Key Ability Timing**:
- **Shield Slam**: **L1** ✨ (Protection exclusive - Arms/Fury get at L12, **11 level gap!**)
- **Taunt**: **L1** ✨ (Protection exclusive - Arms/Fury get at L9, **8 level gap!**)
- **Execute**: **L10** (Arms L3, Fury L7 - Protection gets it latest)
- **Whirlwind**: **L12** (Arms/Fury L1 - Protection gets it latest, **11 level gap!**)

**Design Philosophy**: Protection gets core tank toolkit early (Shield Slam + Taunt at L1, Shield Block + Riposte at L3) to enable tanking from character creation. Offensive abilities (Execute, Whirlwind) come much later because tank focus is survival, not damage. Protection has **most baseline abilities** (20 vs 15) because tanks need utility (ranged pull, CC, threat).

---

## 4.3.9 Hero Talent Transition (L13+)

**At Level 13**, Protection Warriors choose between **2 hero talent specializations**:

---

### Mountain Thane (Fury + Protection)

**Theme**: Storm-empowered warrior, Thunder damage, tankier berserker

**Signature Abilities**:
- **Thunder Clap Enhancement** - Thunder Clap becomes primary damage tool
- **Lightning Strikes** - Rage spenders trigger chain lightning
- **Thorim's Might** - All attacks deal Thunder damage
- **Avatar of the Storm** - Transform into lightning-empowered avatar

**Best For**: Protection Warriors who want damage output without sacrificing tankiness, AoE focus, Thor fantasy

**Synergy with Protection Builds**:
- **Shout Master**: Thunder Clap synergy (Thunderlord talent makes Thunder Clap deal bonus damage + Rage)
- **Block Master**: Lightning Strikes chains during Shield Block windows
- **Riposte Specialist**: Thorim's Might provides Thunder damage on Riposte counter-attacks

**Playstyle**: Tank who controls the battlefield with storm powers—still durable, but with significant AoE damage

**Full Details**: See Section [5] Specializations/Hero Classes

---

### Colossus (Arms + Protection)

**Theme**: Immovable object, ground control, area denial specialist

**Signature Abilities**:
- **Demolish** - Ground slam that creates zone of control
- **Colossal Might** - Size increase, melee range increase, knockback on attacks
- **Mountain of Muscle** - Cannot be moved, CC immunity while standing still
- **Earthen Smash** - Throw boulder for massive single-target damage

**Best For**: Protection Warriors who want to control space, be utterly immovable, fantasy of being a walking fortress

**Synergy with Protection Builds**:
- **Block Master**: Mountain of Muscle synergy (cannot be moved while Shield Block active via Unyielding Stance)
- **Immortal Tank**: Colossal Might grants size increase (intimidation factor), knockback control
- **Shield Slam Burst**: Demolish provides ground control, Earthen Smash adds single-target burst

**Playstyle**: Immovable tank who controls key choke points—enemies cannot push you, you create zones of denial

**Full Details**: See Section [5] Specializations/Hero Classes

---

### Design Note: Hero Talents vs. SubclassSpec Talents

**Key Differences**:
- **L1-L12 (SubclassSpec Talents)**: Player makes **9 choices** (Rows 2-10, one per level, but Row 1 auto-granted)
- **L13-L20 (Hero Talents)**: Player makes **1 choice** (Mountain Thane OR Colossus at L13), then receives **8 auto-granted talents** as they level
- **Auto-Grant Philosophy**: Hero talents are pre-designed power spikes, not customizable—this reduces choice complexity at endgame

**Specialization Choice Impact**:
- **Mountain Thane**: More AoE focused, storm/Thunder theme, damage output boost
- **Colossus**: More single-target control, immovable object, space control

**Cannot Change**: Once you choose at L13, you're committed to that hero talent tree for the character's lifetime

---

### Recommendation Guide

**Choose Mountain Thane if you built**:
- Shout Master (Thunderlord talent synergy, Thunder Clap becomes primary tool)
- Riposte Specialist (Thorim's Might adds Thunder damage to counter-attacks)
- Block Master (Lightning Strikes chains during Shield Block windows)
- Want more damage (Mountain Thane provides AoE damage boost without sacrificing tankiness)

**Choose Colossus if you built**:
- Immortal Tank (Mountain of Muscle synergy, literally cannot be moved)
- Block Master (Unyielding Stance + Mountain of Muscle = ultimate immovability)
- Shield Slam Burst (Earthen Smash adds single-target burst, Demolish adds ground control)
- Want space control (Colossus is best for choke point tanking, area denial)

**Both Work With**: Most Protection builds can use either hero talent—choice often comes down to fantasy preference (storm-powered tank vs. immovable fortress)

### [4.9] Tooltip Archetype Tagging System (Future Enhancement)

**Status**: 📋 **PARKED - User Innovation for Future Implementation**  
**Last Updated**: October 20, 2025  
**Proposed By**: User (October 20, 2025 session)  
**Feasibility**: ✅ **VALIDATED - 90% Working, Just Needs Enhancement**

---

#### Overview

**User Innovation**: Add Build Archetype tags to ability tooltips to help players discover optimal build paths **directly in-game** during talent selection.

**Current State**: Mod already uses `Tags:` system at end of ability descriptions (e.g., `Tags: Generator, Gap-Closer, Control`). These tags are fully visible to players in tooltips.

**Proposed Enhancement**: Extend Tags system to include Build Archetype associations (e.g., `Tags: Spender, Execute • [Execute Build]` or dedicated `Build: Execute Master` line).

**Impact**: Makes build paths discoverable in-game without requiring external wikis/guides. Reduces choice paralysis for 44+ talent options per subclass.

---

#### Feasibility Validation (October 20, 2025)

**Technical Requirements**:
- ✅ BG3 displays plain text from `English.loca.xml` as-is (no sanitization)
- ✅ Line breaks preserved (multi-line descriptions work)
- ✅ Special characters supported (`•`, `[]`, `→` all work)
- ✅ No length limits (just readability concerns)
- ✅ No coding required (just text updates in localization file)
- ✅ No new localization handles needed (reuse existing Description handles, increment version)
- ✅ Already in use (current mod has 20+ abilities with Tags sections)

**WoWWarlock Precedent**: Warlock mod uses custom tooltip formatting with Tags sections, proving approach is viable.

**Validation Document**: `Documentation/07_DesignDocuments/TOOLTIP_ARCHETYPE_TAGGING_FEASIBILITY.md` (comprehensive 400+ line report)

---

#### Three Format Options

**Option A: Inline Tags** (Fastest - 30 min per subclass)
```
Tags: Spender, Execute, High-Damage • [Execute Build]
```

**Option B: Dedicated Line** (Clearest - 45 min per subclass)
```
Tags: Spender, Execute, High-Damage

Build: Execute Master
```

**Option C: Hybrid** (Recommended - 40 min per subclass)
- **Signature abilities** (6 per subclass): Get dedicated `Build: [Archetype]` line
- **Supporting abilities** (~30 per subclass): Get inline ` • [Build Name]` tag

**User Decision**: TBD (parked for future session)

---

#### Build Archetypes per Subclass

**Arms Warrior** (6 archetypes):
1. **Execute Master** - Single-target burst (Execute → Improved Execute → Sudden Death → Massacre)
2. **Bleed Specialist** - DoT focus (Rend → Bloodletting → Sharpened Blades)
3. **Colossus Smash** - Armor break (Colossus Smash → Test of Might → Warbreaker)
4. **Overpower Specialist** - Reactive combat (Overpower → Improved Overpower → Tactician → Storm of Swords)
5. **AoE Specialist** - Multi-target (Cleave → Fervor of Battle → Bladestorm → Dance of Death)
6. **Tank Hybrid** - Defensive Arms (Die by the Sword → Ignore Pain → Spiteful Serenity)

**Fury Warrior** (TBD - to be defined when building [4.2])

**Protection Warrior** (TBD - to be defined when building [4.3])

---

#### Implementation Estimate

| Task | Time per Subclass | Total (3 Specs) |
|------|------------------|-----------------|
| Proof of Concept (6 signature abilities) | 10 min | 10 min (one-time) |
| Full implementation (30-40 abilities) | 30-40 min | ~2 hours |
| Build Archetypes documentation (SOURCE_OF_TRUTH) | 15 min | 45 min |
| Testing and validation | 10 min | 30 min |
| **TOTAL** | ~1 hour | **~3 hours** |

**vs. Documentation-Only Approach**: 15 min per subclass (45 min total)

**Extra Investment**: ~2.5 hours for **massive UX improvement** (in-game build guidance)

---

#### Comparison: Tooltip Tags vs. Documentation

| Aspect | Documentation Only | Tooltip Tags |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Player Visibility** | ❌ External guides required | ✅ Visible during level-up |
| **Discoverability** | ❌ Low (need to search) | ✅ High (immediate context) |
| **Implementation Time** | 15 min/spec | 1 hour/spec |
| **Maintenance** | Easy | Easy (text-only updates) |
| **Impact** | Developer/wiki reference | Direct player UX |
| **Replicability** | Yes | Yes (same pattern) |
| **Unique Value** | Planning aid | In-game guidance |

**Verdict**: Tooltip tags are **superior in every way** except implementation time (+2.5 hours total investment).

---

#### Example Implementation

**Signature Ability - Execute (Before)**:
```xml
<content contentuid="h125abc05" version="4">Strike down critically wounded enemies with a devastating blow.

Deal [1] damage to enemies below [2]% HP.
Costs [3] Rage.

Action • Melee Weapon Attack

Tags: Spender, Execute, High-Damage</content>
```

**Signature Ability - Execute (After - Dedicated Line Format)**:
```xml
<content contentuid="h125abc05" version="5">Strike down critically wounded enemies with a devastating blow.

Deal [1] damage to enemies below [2]% HP.
Costs [3] Rage.

Action • Melee Weapon Attack

Tags: Spender, Execute, High-Damage

Build: Execute Master</content>
```

**Supporting Ability - Sudden Death (After - Inline Format)**:
```xml
<content contentuid="h125abc99" version="2">Your Execute ability can trigger even on healthy enemies.

Execute has a 10% chance to reset its cooldown and become usable on any target.

Passive • [Execute Build]

Tags: Passive, Execute-Proc</content>
```

---

#### Implementation Workflow (When Resumed)

**Phase 1: Proof of Concept** (10 min)
1. Choose format (Inline, Dedicated, or Hybrid)
2. Update 6 signature abilities (one per Arms archetype)
3. Test in-game to verify tooltips display correctly
4. Get user approval on appearance/readability

**Phase 2: Full Arms Implementation** (30-40 min)
1. Update all ~30-40 Arms talent descriptions
2. Apply chosen format consistently
3. Increment localization handle versions correctly
4. Validate no duplicate handles

**Phase 3: Documentation** (15 min)
1. Add build archetypes to Section [4.1] Arms
2. Document pattern for Fury/Protection replication

**Phase 4: Replicate to Fury/Protection** (1-1.5 hours each)
1. Define build archetypes for Fury (when building [4.2])
2. Define build archetypes for Protection (when building [4.3])
3. Apply same tooltip tagging pattern

---

#### Why This Enhancement Matters

**Competitive Advantage**:
- Most BG3 class mods require constant wiki/guide reference
- This mod would show build paths **directly in-game**
- Players can make informed talent choices during level-up
- Reduces choice paralysis (44 scattered talents → 6 clear build paths)

**Comparable To**:
- WoW Retail's "Recommended" talent indicators
- Path of Exile's build archetype tags
- Diablo 4's specialization hints

**But Implemented Purely Through Modding** (no engine changes needed)!

#### Status: PARKED

**Reason**: User chose to prioritize all 3 documentation improvements first (Build Archetypes, Prerequisites, Hero Talent Preview). Tooltip tagging implementation will be considered after Section [4] completion.

**Resume Point**: After [4.1], [4.2], [4.3] documentation complete, revisit tooltip tagging decision with full context of all 3 subclasses' build paths documented.

**Estimated Resume**: After Section [4] complete (~3-4 hours from October 20, 2025)

## [5] Specializations/Hero Classes L13-20

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Last Updated**: October 21, 2025

---

### Overview

At **Level 13**, Warriors choose one of **three hero talent specializations** that define their endgame playstyle (L13-20). Unlike SubclassSpec talents (L3-12), hero talents are **fully auto-granted**—players make **one choice at L13**, then receive **all remaining talents automatically** as they level.

**Key Differences from SubclassSpec Talents**:
- **SubclassSpec Talents (L3-12)**: 8-10 player choices, one per level
- **Hero Talents (L13-20)**: **1 player choice** (at L13), then 9 auto-granted talents

**Design Philosophy**: Hero talents provide **pre-designed power spikes** without overwhelming players with choices at endgame. Each specialization has a unique fantasy theme and synergizes with specific subclass builds.

---

### Hero Talent Availability by Subclass

| Hero Talent | Available To | Primary Theme | Playstyle |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Mountain Thane** | Protection + Fury | Storm/Lightning Warrior | Tanky berserker with Thunder damage, AoE focus |
| **Colossus** | Arms + Protection | Titan/Immovable Object | Massive strikes, space control, ground slam specialist |
| **Slayer** | Arms + Fury | Executioner/Assassin | Relentless pursuit of wounded enemies, Execute specialist |

**Cannot Change**: Once chosen at L13, the hero talent selection is **permanent** for that character.

## [5.5] Design Philosophy

### Auto-Grant vs. Choice Mechanics

**SubclassSpec Talents (L3-12)**:
- **Player Choices**: 8-10 choices (one per level, varies by subclass)
- **Philosophy**: Build customization, multiple viable paths per subclass
- **Example**: Arms has 6 build archetypes (Execute Master, Bleed Specialist, etc.)

**Hero Talents (L13-20)**:
- **Player Choices**: **1 choice only** (at L13, choosing specialization)
- **Philosophy**: Pre-designed power spikes, reduces endgame choice complexity
- **Rationale**: Players already made 8-10 choices during L3-12; hero talents reward that investment with curated endgame power

---

### Level 13-20 Progression Pattern

**Standard Pattern** (all 3 hero talents follow this):
- **L13**: Keystone talent auto-granted (defines specialization identity)
- **L14**: Empty level (no talents)
- **L15**: 3 talents auto-granted (first power spike)
- **L16**: Feat/ASI only (no talents)
- **L17**: 3 talents auto-granted (second power spike)
- **L18**: Empty level (no talents)
- **L19**: 3 talents auto-granted (third power spike)
- **L20**: Capstone talent auto-granted (ultimate power)

**Total Progression**: 1 keystone + 9 auto-grants = 10 talents per specialization

---

### Why Only 1 Choice at L13?

**Design Rationale**:
1. **Reduces choice paralysis** at endgame (players already overwhelmed by L1-12 choices)
2. **Curated power spikes** ensure balanced progression (no "trap" build choices at high level)
3. **Fantasy commitment** (choosing Mountain Thane/Colossus/Slayer is a major character identity decision)
4. **BG3 level cap** (L20 is max level—no room for experimentation at endgame)

**Trade-off**: Less customization, but ensures all players get complete hero talent experience without needing respec.

---

### Fantasy Themes

**Mountain Thane**: Thor/Thorim-inspired storm warrior
- **Visual**: Lightning effects, Thunder damage, storm aura
- **Audio**: Thunder claps, lightning strikes, storm sounds
- **Gameplay**: AoE damage focus, tanky berserker, storm control

**Colossus**: Titan/Immovable Object
- **Visual**: Size increase, ground slam effects, earthquake visuals
- **Audio**: Heavy impacts, earth-shattering sounds, titan roars
- **Gameplay**: Space control, choke point denial, massive single strikes

**Slayer**: Relentless Executioner/Assassin
- **Visual**: Aggressive animations, Execute effects, bleed visuals
- **Audio**: Brutal strike sounds, wounded enemy cries, relentless assault
- **Gameplay**: Execute spam, wounded enemy focus, ruthless pursuit

---

### Difference from SubclassSpec Talents

| Attribute | SubclassSpec Talents (L3-12) | Hero Talents (L13-20) |
|-----------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Player Choices** | 8-10 choices | 1 choice (at L13) |
| **Customization** | High (6 build archetypes per subclass) | Low (pre-designed paths) |
| **Power Spikes** | Gradual (1 talent per level) | Concentrated (3 talents at L15/17/19) |
| **Commitment** | Can respec if needed | Permanent (cannot change after L13) |
| **Complexity** | High (44+ talents per subclass) | Low (10 talents per specialization) |
| **Fantasy** | Subclass identity (Arms/Fury/Protection) | Endgame identity (Mountain Thane/Colossus/Slayer) |
