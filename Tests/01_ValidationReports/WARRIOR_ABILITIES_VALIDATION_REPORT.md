## BASELINE WARRIOR ABILITIES (19 Total)

### Core Attacks

#### 1. Heroic Strike ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW
**WoW Source**: Not in modern WoW (removed in Mists of Pandaria)  
**Classic WoW**: Rage **spender** that enhanced next auto-attack  
**Current Implementation**:
- **Type**: Bonus Action
- **Damage**: 1d8 + STR
- **Effect**: Generates 15 Rage
- **Cooldown**: None
- **Tags**: GENERATOR, SingleTarget, MeleeWeapon

**Validation**:
- ❌ WoW Fidelity: Ability doesn't exist in modern WoW
- ❌ Function Inverted: Was Rage **spender** in Classic, now a **generator**
- ✅ BG3 Need: Warriors need basic Rage generator (no auto-attacks)
- ✅ Action economy: Bonus Action (fills gap in rotation)
- ⚠️ Name Confusion: "Strike" implies big hit, but it's basic attack

**Issue**: Ability name creates false expectations. In Classic WoW it was a Rage dump; in BG3 it's a basic generator. Name doesn't match function.

**Recommendations** (See ABILITY_DESIGN_FRAMEWORK.md for full analysis):
1. **Option A**: Rename to "Weapon Strike" - honest about being basic attack
2. **Option B**: Replace with "Sunder Armor" - classic warrior ability with flavor (-1 AC per stack, max 3)
3. **Keep mechanics** but update name/description for clarity

**Status**: FUNCTIONAL BUT MISLEADING - Recommend rename/rework

#### 2. Slam ✅ VERIFIED (with adjustment)
**WoW Source**: "Slam - initial rage spender, quickly replaced by other abilities"  
**WoW Cooldown**: None (GCD only)  
**Implementation**:
- **Type**: Action
- **Damage**: 2d6 + STR (Bludgeoning)
- **Cost**: 15 Rage
- **Cooldown**: Once per Turn
- **Tags**: SPENDER, DAMAGE, SingleTarget, MeleeWeapon

**Validation**:
- ✅ WoW Fidelity: "Initial rage spender" - basic damage ability
- ✅ Rage cost: 15 (appropriate for basic spender)
- ✅ Damage: 2d6 slightly higher than Heroic Strike (1d8) - justified by Action cost
- ✅ Cooldown: Once per Turn prevents spam (ADJUSTED from None - BG3 adaptation)
- ✅ BG3 Adaptation: Alternative to Heroic Strike for Action economy

**Adjustments Made**:
- Added "Once per Turn" cooldown to prevent Action spam (WoW has no cooldown but BG3 needs gating)

**Status**: CORRECT (BALANCED)

---

### Support Abilities

#### 16. Battle Shout ❌ COOLDOWN ERROR
**WoW Source**: "Battle Shout (Shout) - worth ~5% damage for melee classes and Hunters"

**Implementation**:
- **Type**: Bonus Action (Shout, 9m radius)
- **Effect**: +2 attack rolls, +2 damage for 5 turns
- **Cooldown**: ~~Once per Short Rest~~ **Should be None**

- ✅ WoW Fidelity: "~5% damage" → +2 attack/damage ~10% in BG3 (generous)
- ✅ Radius: 9m (party-wide)

  - **Reason**: 5-turn duration prevents stacking, Bonus Action cost sufficient

**Issue**: See COOLDOWN_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md - Fix needed

**Status**: NEEDS FIX - Remove cooldown

- ✅ Temp HP: 2d8+level (scaling defensive)
- ✅ Radius: 9m (party-wide)
- ❌ **Cooldown ERROR**: Has Short Rest cooldown, should be None
  - **Reason**: Bonus Action cost is significant trade-off
  - **Temp HP doesn't stack**: Can't spam for OP results

**Issue**: See COOLDOWN_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md - Fix needed

**Status**: NEEDS FIX - Remove cooldown

---

  - **WoW**: 90s CD but didn't have Rage cost (BG3 does)

**Issue**: See COOLDOWN_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md - Fix needed

**Status**: NEEDS FIX - Remove cooldown

---

### Mobility

#### 19. Heroic Leap ❌ COOLDOWN ERROR

## ISSUES FOUND

### High Priority - Cooldown Errors

#### 1. Heroic Leap - Wrong Cooldown ❌
**Issue**: Has Short Rest cooldown, should be **Long Rest**  
**Source**: WoW 45 seconds (45s+ → Long Rest conversion)  
**Current**: `data "Cooldown" "OncePerShortRest"`  
**Fix**: Change to `data "Cooldown" "OncePerLongRest"`  
**File**: Spell_Jump.txt line ~27

**Impact**: Major mobility tool is too accessible, should be limited to Long Rest

---

#### 2. Battle Shout - Unnecessary Cooldown ❌
**Issue**: Has Short Rest cooldown, should have **no cooldown**  
**Source**: WoW 60s CD but 1 hour duration = effectively no CD  
**Current**: `data "Cooldown" "OncePerShortRest"`  
**Fix**: Remove cooldown entirely  
**File**: Spell_Shout.txt line ~47

**Reason**: 5-turn duration prevents stacking, Bonus Action cost sufficient gating

---

#### 3. Rallying Cry - Unnecessary Cooldown ❌
**Issue**: Has Short Rest cooldown, should have **no cooldown**  
**Source**: WoW 3min CD but BG3 has Action cost (WoW doesn't)  
**Current**: `data "Cooldown" "OncePerShortRest"`  
**Fix**: Remove cooldown entirely  
**File**: Spell_Shout.txt line ~81

**Reason**: Bonus Action cost significant, temp HP doesn't stack

---

#### 4. Intimidating Shout - Unnecessary Cooldown ❌
**Issue**: Has Short Rest cooldown, should have **no cooldown**  
**Source**: WoW 90s CD but didn't have Rage cost (BG3 does)  
**Current**: `data "Cooldown" "OncePerShortRest"`  
**Fix**: Remove cooldown entirely  
**File**: Spell_Shout.txt line ~114

**Reason**: 10 Rage + Action + WIS save + breaks on damage = heavily gated already

---

### Medium Priority

#### 5. Victory Rush Mechanic ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Was using "below 30% HP" instead of "after kill"  
**Source**: "very useful free heal after getting a kill"  
**Fix Applied**: 
- Added WAR_VictoryRush_Passive (grants WAR_VICTORIOUS on kill)
- Added WAR_VICTORIOUS status (2 turn duration)
- Changed spell to require WAR_VICTORIOUS status
- Spell consumes status on use

**Status**: RESOLVED

---

#### 6. Sweeping Strikes Attack Tracking ⚠️
**Issue**: May cleave for full 2 turns instead of exactly 2 attacks  
**Current**: Duration-based (2 turns)  
**Expected**: Attack counter (exactly 2 attacks)

**Recommendation**: Consider adding attack counter via scripting if available

---

#### 7. Heroic Strike Naming/Function Mismatch ⚠️
**Issue**: Name creates false expectations (was Rage spender in Classic WoW, now generator)  
**Current**: Works functionally but misleading  
**Recommendation**: Rename to "Weapon Strike" (see ABILITY_DESIGN_FRAMEWORK.md)

**Status**: Pending user decision

---

### Low Priority

#### 8. Spell Reflection Duration ℹ️
**Note**: WoW has lower cooldown but same effect. BG3 has Long Rest cooldown with 1 turn duration.  
**Reason**: BG3 spell damage less frequent, full immunity is stronger than reflection  
**Status**: Acceptable adaptation

---

## RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Immediate Priority (Cooldown Errors)

2. ❌ **Battle Shout** - REMOVE: Cooldown (duration + Bonus Action sufficient)
3. ❌ **Rallying Cry** - REMOVE: Cooldown (Bonus Action cost sufficient)
4. ❌ **Intimidating Shout** - REMOVE: Cooldown (10 Rage + Action sufficient)

See **COOLDOWN_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md** for detailed fix instructions

### Completed
5. ✅ **Victory Rush** - FIXED: Now works after kill with proper on-kill trigger
6. ✅ **Mortal Strike** - VERIFIED: Has Once per Turn cooldown (already correct)

### Future Consideration
7. ⚠️ **Sweeping Strikes** - ENHANCE: Add attack counter if scripting available
8. ⚠️ **Heroic Strike** - RENAME: To "Weapon Strike" for clarity (pending user decision)
