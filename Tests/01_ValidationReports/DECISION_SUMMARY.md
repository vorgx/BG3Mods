# Decision Summary & Findings
**Date**: October 16, 2025

---

## USER DECISIONS MADE

### Decision 1: Heroic Strike Solution ✅
**User Choice**: N/A - **Sunder Armor has naming conflict**

**Analysis Results**:
- ❌ **Sunder Armor NOT viable**: WAR_SUNDERED_ARMOR already exists (used by Warbreaker)
- ✅ **Recommended Alternative**: Rename to "Weapon Strike"
  - Honest about function (basic Rage generator)
  - No conflicts with existing abilities
  - 5-minute fix (just localization change)

**Pending**: User needs to confirm rename to "Weapon Strike" or choose another option

---

### Decision 2: Tooltip Tag Format ✅
**User Choice**: **Option 2** - Description footer format

**Implementation**:
```
[Main description text]

[Resource Cost] • [Cooldown]

Tags: [Primary], [Delivery], [Special Mechanics]
```

**Example**:
```
Deal 2d10 + Strength modifier damage.
Apply Mortal Wound: Target receives -50% healing for 2 turns.

30 Rage • Once per Turn

Tags: Damage, Single-Target, Healing Reduction
```

**Status**: ⏳ Ready to implement in English.loca.xml

## MAJOR FINDINGS

### Cooldown Verification Complete ✅

**4 Cooldown Errors Found** (out of 19 baseline abilities = 21% error rate):

| Ability | Current | Should Be | Priority |
|---------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Heroic Leap** | Short Rest | **Long Rest** | HIGH ❌ |
| **Battle Shout** | Short Rest | **None** | HIGH ❌ |
| **Rallying Cry** | Short Rest | **None** | HIGH ❌ |
| **Intimidating Shout** | Short Rest | **None** | HIGH ❌ |

**Root Cause**: Conservative balancing during initial implementation didn't account for:
- BG3's Rage economy (which WoW doesn't have the same way)
- Action/Bonus Action opportunity costs
- Duration-based gating (Battle Shout's 5 turns)
- Multiple gating mechanisms stacking (Intimidating Shout: Rage + Action + Save + breaks on damage)

**Impact**: Over-gated abilities reduce warrior flexibility and fun

## KEY INSIGHTS

### Why Cooldown Errors Happened
1. **Conservative Balancing**: Initial implementation erred on side of caution
2. **WoW Direct Translation**: Didn't account for BG3 resource differences
3. **Missing Context**: Rage economy adds gating that WoW doesn't have
4. **Action Economy**: Bonus Action opportunity cost not factored in

### Why These Fixes Are Safe
1. **Battle Shout**: 5-turn duration means it won't stack anyway
2. **Rallying Cry**: Temp HP doesn't stack, Bonus Action is valuable
3. **Intimidating Shout**: 4 gating mechanisms (Rage, Action, Save, breaks on damage)
4. **Heroic Leap**: Still limited, just Long Rest instead of Short Rest

### Validation Process Working
- ✅ Found real issues (4 cooldown errors)
- ✅ Categorized by priority (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- ✅ Provided specific fixes with locations
- ✅ Explained reasoning for each change
- ✅ Created reusable checklist for future work

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Cooldown Fixes
**Implement all 4 fixes immediately** - They improve gameplay without breaking balance:
- Heroic Leap becomes appropriately limited (major mobility)
- Battle Shout/Rallying Cry become more usable (situational buffs)
- Intimidating Shout respects multi-gating design (Rage + Action sufficient)

### For Tooltip Tags
**Start with Option 2 format** - Clean, informative, doesn't clutter DisplayName:
- Add to Description field in English.loca.xml
- Use tag matrix from ABILITY_DESIGN_FRAMEWORK.md
- Can iterate later if needed

### For Heroic Strike
**Rename to "Weapon Strike"** - Honest, simple, no conflicts:
- Update DisplayName localization handle
- Update Description to clarify it's basic Rage generator
- Minimal work, maximum clarity
